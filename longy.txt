a blog a truncation of weblog1 is an informational website published on the world wide web consisting of discrete often informal diarystyle text entries posts posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first at the top of the web page until 2009 blogs were usually the work of a single individualcitation needed occasionally of a small group and often covered a single subject or topic in the 2010s multiauthor blogs mabs emerged featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited mabs from newspapers other media outlets universities think tanks advocacy groups and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic the rise of twitter and other microblogging systems helps integrate mabs and singleauthor blogs into the news media blog can also be used as a verb meaning to maintain or add content to a blog

the emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by nontechnical users who did not have much experience with html or computer programming previously knowledge of such technologies as html and file transfer protocol had been required to publish content on the web and early web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts as of the 2010s the majority are interactive web 20 websites allowing visitors to leave online comments and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites2 in that sense blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service indeed bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers3 blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content there are also highreadership blogs which do not allow comments

many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic ranging from philosophy religion and arts to science politics and sports others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company a typical blog combines text digital images and links to other blogs web pages and other media related to its topic most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on art art blogs photographs photoblogs videos video blogs or vlogs music mp3 blogs and audio podcasts in education blogs can be used as instructional resources these are referred to as edublogs microblogging is another type of blogging featuring very short posts

blog and blogging are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media especially when the content is longform and one creates and shares content on regular basis so one could be maintaining a blog on facebook or blogging on instagram blogging is writing about what you like in other words writing about what you know and providing valuable information to people searching for it

a 2022 estimate suggested that there were over 600 million public blogs out of more than 19 billion websites4

history
main articles history of blogging and online diary

an early example of a diary style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in realtime from a wearable computer with headup display february 22 1995
the term weblog was coined by jorn barger5 on december 17 1997 the short form blog was coined by peter merholz who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog petermecom in may 1999678 shortly thereafter evan williams at pyra labs used blog as both a noun and verb to blog meaning to edit ones weblog or to post to ones weblog and devised the term blogger in connection with pyra labs blogger product leading to the popularization of the terms9

origins
before blogging became popular digital communities took many forms including usenet commercial online services such as genie byte information exchange bix and the early compuserve email lists10 and bulletin board systems bbs in the 1990s internet forum software created running conversations with threads threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual corkboardfurther explanation needed

bernerslee also created what is considered by encyclopedia britannica to be the first blog in 1992 to discuss the progress made on creating the world wide web and software used for it11

from june 14 1993 mosaic communications corporation maintained their whats new12 list of new websites updated daily and archived monthly the page was accessible by a special whats new button in the mosaic web browser

the earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer web site created in 1995 by ty inc which featured a blog in a section called online diary the entries were maintained by featured beanie babies that were voted for monthly by web site visitors13

the modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives most such writers called themselves diarists journalists or journalers justin hall who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at swarthmore college is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers14 as is jerry pournelle15 dave winers scripting news is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs1617 the australian netguide magazine maintained the daily net news18 on their web site from 1996 daily net news ran links and daily reviews of new websites mostly in australia

another early blog was wearable wireless webcam an online shared diary of a persons personal life combining text digital video and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and eyetap device to a web site in 1994 this practice of semiautomated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters some early bloggers such as the misanthropic bitch who began in 1997 actually referred to their online presence as a zine before the term blog entered common usage

the first research paper about blogging was torill mortensen and jill walker rettbergs paper blogging thoughts19 which analysed how blogs were being used to foster research communities and the exchange of ideas and scholarship and how this new means of networking overturns traditional power structures

technology
early blogs were simply manually updated components of common websites in 1995 the online diary on the ty inc web site was produced and updated manually before any blogging programs were available posts were made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating textbased html code using ftp software in real time several times a day to users this offered the appearance of a live diary that contained multiple new entries per day at the beginning of each new day new diary entries were manually coded into a new html file and at the start of each month diary entries were archived into their own folder which contained a separate html page for every day of the month then menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated manually throughout the site this textbased method of organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years later13

the evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible for a much larger and less technicallyinclined population ultimately this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today for instance the use of some sort of browserbased software is now a typical aspect of blogging blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services on regular web hosting services or run using blog software

rise in popularity
after a slow start blogging rapidly gained in popularity blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following being further popularized by the nearsimultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools

bruce ableson launched open diary in october 1998 which soon grew to thousands of online diaries open diary innovated the reader comment becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers blog entries
brad fitzpatrick started livejournal in march 1999
andrew smales created pitascom in july 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a news page on a web site followed by diaryland in september 1999 focusing more on a personal diary community20
evan williams and meg hourihan pyra labs launched bloggercom in august 1999 purchased by google in february 2003
political impact

on december 6 2002 josh marshalls talkingpointsmemocom blog called attention to us senator lotts comments regarding senator thurmond senator lott was eventually to resign his senate leadership position over the matter
an early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002 when many bloggers focused on comments by us senate majority leader trent lott21 senator lott at a party honoring us senator strom thurmond praised senator thurmond by suggesting that the united states would have been better off had thurmond been elected president lotts critics saw these comments as tacit approval of racial segregation a policy advocated by thurmonds 1948 presidential campaign this view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers see josh marshalls talking points memo though lotts comments were made at a public event attended by the media no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced lott to step down as majority leader

similarly blogs were among the driving forces behind the rathergate scandal television journalist dan rather presented documents on the cbs show 60 minutes that conflicted with accepted accounts of president bushs military service record bloggers declared the documents to be forgeries and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view consequently cbs apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques see little green footballs the impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination

in russia some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official overwhelmingly progovernment media bloggers such as rustem adagamov and alexei navalny have many followers and the latters nickname for the ruling united russia party as the party of crooks and thieves has been adopted by antiregime protesters22 this led to the wall street journal calling navalny the man vladimir putin fears most in march 201223

mainstream popularity
by 2004 the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream as political consultants news services and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs role as a news source see howard dean and wesley clark even politicians not actively campaigning such as the uks labour partys member of parliament mp tom watson began to blog to bond with constituents in january 2005 fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people could not ignore peter rojas xeni jardin ben trott mena trott jonathan schwartz jason goldman robert scoble and jason calacanis24

israel was among the first national governments to set up an official blog25 under david saranga the israeli ministry of foreign affairs became active in adopting web 20 initiatives including an official video blog25 and a political blog26 the foreign ministry also held a microblogging press conference via twitter about its war with hamas with saranga answering questions from the public in common textmessaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference27 the questions and answers were later posted on israelpolitik the countrys official political blog28

the impact of blogging on the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments in 2009 the presence of the american journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government us president barack obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying if the direction of the news is all blogosphere all opinions with no serious factchecking no serious attempts to put stories in context then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding29 between 2009 and 2012 an orwell prize for blogging was awarded

types

a screenshot from the blogactive website
there are many different types of blogs differing not only in the type of content but also in the way that content is delivered or written

personal blogs
the personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual rather than a corporation or organization while the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers other than the bloggers immediate family and friends a small number of personal blogs have become popular to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship a tiny number of personal bloggers have become famous both in the online community and in the real world
collaborative blogs or group blogs
a type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author the majority of highprofile collaborative blogs are organised according to a single uniting theme such as politics technology or advocacy in recent years the blogosphere has seen the emergence and growing popularity of more collaborative efforts often set up by already established bloggers wishing to pool time and resources both to reduce the pressure of maintaining a popular website and to attract a larger readership
microblogging
microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital contentwhich could be text pictures links short videos or other mediaon the internet microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users it has captured the public imagination in part because the short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting friends use it to keep in touch business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources and celebrities and politicians or their publicists microblog about concert dates lectures book releases or tour schedules a wide and growing range of addon tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications the resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication30 examples of these include twitter facebook tumblr and by far the largest weibo
corporate and organizational blogs
a blog can be private as in most cases or it can be for business or notforprofit organization or government purposes blogs used internally and only available to employees via an intranet are called corporate blogs companies use internal corporate blogs to enhance the communication culture and employee engagement in a corporation internal corporate blogs can be used to communicate news about company policies or procedures build employee esprit de corps and improve morale companies and other organizations also use external publicly accessible blogs for marketing branding or public relations purposes some organizations have a blog authored by their executive in practice many of these executive blog posts are penned by a ghostwriter who makes posts in the style of the credited author similar blogs for clubs and societies are called club blogs group blogs or by similar names typical use is to inform members and other interested parties of club and member activities
aggregated blogs
individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on a specific topic product or service and provide a combined view for its readers this allows readers to concentrate on reading instead of searching for quality ontopic content and managing subscriptions many such aggregations called planets from name of planet software that perform such aggregation hosting sites usually have planet subdomain in domain name like http planetgnomeorg 
by genre
some blogs focus on a particular subject such as political blogs journalism blogs health blogs travel blogs also known as travelogs gardening blogs house blogs book blogs3132 fashion blogs beauty blogs lifestyle blogs party blogs wedding blogs photography blogs project blogs psychology blogs sociology blogs education blogs niche blogs classical music blogs quizzing blogs legal blogs often referred to as a blawgs or dreamlogs howto tutorial blogs are becoming increasing popular33 two common types of genre blogs are art blogs and music blogs a blog featuring discussions especially about home and family is not uncommonly called a mom blog while not a legitimate type of blog one used for the sole purpose of spamming is known as a splog
by media type
a blog comprising videos is called a vlog one comprising links is called a linklog a site containing a portfolio of sketches is called a sketchblog or one comprising photos is called a photoblog blogs with shorter posts and mixed media types are called tumblelogs blogs that are written on typewriters and then scanned are called typecast or typecast blogs a rare type of blog hosted on the gopher protocol is known as a phlog
by device
a blog can also be defined by which type of device is used to compose it a blog written by a mobile device like a mobile phone or pda could be called a moblog34 one early blog was wearable wireless webcam an online shared diary of a persons personal life combining text video and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and eyetap device to a web site this practice of semiautomated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance such journals have been used as evidence in legal matterscitation needed
reverse blog
a reverse blog is composed by its users rather than a single blogger this system has the characteristics of a blog and the writing of several authors these can be written by several contributing authors on a topic or opened up for anyone to write there is typically some limit to the number of entries to keep it from operating like a web forumcitation needed
community and cataloging

an artists depiction of the interconnections between blogs and blog authors in the blogosphere in 2007
blogosphere
the collective community of all blogs and blog authors particularly notable and widely read blogs is known as the blogosphere since all blogs are on the internet by definition they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked through blogrolls comments linkbacks refbacks trackbacks or pingbacks and backlinks discussions in the blogosphere were occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues because new untapped communities of bloggers and their readers can emerge in the space of a few years internet marketers pay close attention to trends in the blogosphere35
blog search engines
several blog search engines have been used to search blog contents such as bloglines defunct blogscope defunct and technorati defunct
blogging communities and directories
several online communities exist that connect people to blogs and bloggers to other bloggers interestspecific blogging platforms are also available for instance blogster has a sizable community of political bloggers among its members global voices aggregates international bloggers with emphasis on voices that are not ordinarily heard in international mainstream media36
blogging and advertising
it is common for blogs to feature banner advertisements or promotional content either to financially benefit the blogger support website hosting costs or to promote the bloggers favourite causes or products the popularity of blogs has also given rise to fake blogs in which a company will create a fictional blog as a marketing tool to promote a product37
as the popularity of blogging continued to rise as of 2006 the commercialisation of blogging is rapidly increasing many corporations and companies collaborate with bloggers to increase advertising and engage online communities with their products in the book fans bloggers and gamers henry jenkins stated that bloggers take knowledge into their own hands enabling successful navigation within and between these emerging knowledge cultures one can see such behaviour as cooptation into commodity culture insofar as it sometimes collaborates with corporate interests but one can also see it as increasing the diversity of media culture providing opportunities for greater inclusiveness and making more responsive to consumers38

early popularity
before 2006 the blogdex project was launched by researchers in the mit media lab to crawl the web and gather data from thousands of blogs to investigate their social properties information was gathered by the tool for over four years during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community ranking it by recency and popularity it can thereforeoriginal research be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker the project was replaced by tailrankcom which in turn has been replaced by spinn3rcom
2006 blogs are given rankings by alexa internet web hits of alexa toolbar users and formerly by blog search engine technorati based on the number of incoming links technorati stopped doing this in 2014 in august 2006 technorati found that the most linkedto blog on the internet was that of chinese actress xu jinglei39 chinese media xinhua reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world40better source needed technorati rated boing boing to be the mostread groupwritten blog39
2008 as of 2008 blogging had become such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day41 researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular there are essentially two measures of this popularity through citations as well as popularity through affiliation ie blogroll the basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls permalinks can boost popularity more quickly and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls since they denote that people are actually reading the blogs content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases42
blurring with the mass media
many bloggers particularly those engaged in participatory journalism are amateur journalists and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in mainstream media organizations other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online rather than via a tv station or newspaper either as an addon to a traditional media presence eg hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper or as their sole journalistic output some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of getting around the filter of media gatekeepers and pushing their messages directly to the public many mainstream journalists meanwhile write their own blogswell over 300 according to cyberjournalistnets jblog listcitation needed the first known use of a blog on a news site was in august 1998 when jonathan dube of the charlotte observer published one chronicling hurricane bonnie43

some bloggers have moved over to other media the following bloggers and others have appeared on radio and television duncan black known widely by his pseudonym atrios glenn reynolds instapundit markos moulitsas zuniga daily kos alex steffen worldchanging ana marie cox wonkette nate silver fivethirtyeightcom and ezra klein ezra klein blog in the american prospect now in the washington post in counterpoint hugh hewitt exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction adding to his reach in old media by being an influential blogger similarly it was emergency preparedness and safety tips on air and online blog articles that captured surgeon general of the united states richard carmonas attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host lisa tolliver and westchester emergency volunteer reservesmedical reserve corps director marianne partridge4445

blogs have also had an influence on minority languages bringing together scattered speakers and learners this is particularly so with blogs in gaelic languages minority language publishing which may lack economic feasibility can find its audience through inexpensive blogging there are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs eg salam pax ellen simonetti jessica cutler and scrappleface blogbased books have been given the name blook a prize for the best blogbased book was initiated in 200546 the lulu blooker prize47 however success has been elusive offline with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs the book based on julie powells blog the julie julia project was made into the film julie & julia apparently the first to do so

consumergenerated advertising
consumergenerated advertising is a relatively new and controversial development and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers among the various forms of advertising on blog the most controversial are the sponsored posts48 these are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback reviews opinion videos etc and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model where companies can skip over the advertising agencies previously the only interface with the customer and contact the customers directly via social media websites on the other hand new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established to take advantage of this new development as well however there are many people who look negatively on this new development some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogospheres credibility49

legal and social consequences
blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences50

defamation or liability
several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability us payouts related to blogging totalled $174 million by 2009 in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance51 the courts have returned with mixed verdicts internet service providers isps in general are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties us communications decency act and the eu directive 2000 31 ec in doe v cahill the delaware supreme court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself as unfounded under american libel law rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration52 in a bizarre twist the cahills were able to obtain the identity of john doe who turned out to be the person they suspected the towns mayor councilman cahills political rival the cahills amended their original complaint and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial

in january 2007 two prominent malaysian political bloggers jeff ooi and ahirudin attan were sued by a progovernment newspaper the new straits times press malaysia berhad kalimullah bin masheerul hassan hishamuddin bin aun and brenden john a l john pereira over alleged defamation the plaintiff was supported by the malaysian government53 following the suit the malaysian government proposed to register all bloggers in malaysia to better control parties against their interests54 this is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country in the united states blogger aaron wall was sued by traffic power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 200555 according to wired magazine traffic power had been banned from google for allegedly rigging search engine results56 wall and other white hat search engine optimization consultants had exposed traffic power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public the case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction and traffic power failed to appeal within the allowed time57

in 2009 ndtv issued a legal notice to indian blogger kunte for a blog post criticizing their coverage of the mumbai attacks58 the blogger unconditionally withdrew his post which resulted in several indian bloggers criticizing ndtv for trying to silence critics59

employment
employees who blog about elements of their place of employment can begin to affect the reputation of their employer either in a positive way if the employee is praising the employer and its workplaces or in a negative way if the blogger is making negative comments about the company or its practices

in general attempts by employee bloggers to protect themselves by maintaining anonymity have proved ineffective60 in 2009 a controversial and landmark decision by the hon mr justice eady refused to grant an order to protect the anonymity of richard horton horton was a police officer in the united kingdom who blogged about his job under the name nightjack61

delta air lines fired flight attendant ellen simonetti because she posted photographs of herself in uniform on an aeroplane and because of comments posted on her blog queen of sky diary of a flight attendant which the employer deemed inappropriate6263 this case highlighted the issue of personal blogging and freedom of expression versus employer rights and responsibilities and so it received wide media attention simonetti took legal action against the airline for wrongful termination defamation of character and lost future wages64 the suit was postponed while delta was in bankruptcy proceedings65

in early 2006 erik ringmar a senior lecturer at the london school of economics was ordered by the convenor of his department to take down and destroy his blog in which he discussed the quality of education at the school66

mark jen was terminated in 2005 after 10 days of employment as an assistant product manager at google for discussing corporate secrets on his personal blog then called 99zeros and hosted on the googleowned blogger service67 he blogged about unreleased products and company finances a week before the companys earnings announcement he was fired two days after he complied with his employers request to remove the sensitive material from his blog68

in india blogger gaurav sabnis resigned from ibm after his posts questioned the claims made by a management school69 jessica cutler aka the washingtonienne blogged about her sex life while employed as a congressional assistant after the blog was discovered and she was fired70 she wrote a novel based on her experiences and blog the washingtonienne a novel as of 2006 cutler is being sued by one of her former lovers in a case that could establish the extent to which bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of their real life associates71

catherine sanderson aka petite anglaise lost her job in paris at a british accountancy firm because of blogging72 although given in the blog in a fairly anonymous manner some of the descriptions of the firm and some of its people were less than flattering sanderson later won a compensation claim case against the british firm however73

on the other hand penelope trunk wrote an upbeat article in the boston globe in 2006 entitled blogs essential to a good career74 she was one of the first journalists to point out that a large portion of bloggers are professionals and that a wellwritten blog can help attract employers

business owners
business owners who blog about their business can also run into legal consequences mark cuban owner of the dallas mavericks was fined during the 2006 nba playoffs for criticizing nba officials on the court and in his blog75

political dangers
see also political repression of cyberdissidents
blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas in some countries internet police or secret police may monitor blogs and arrest blog authors or commentators blogs can be much harder to control than broadcast or print media because a person can create a blog whose authorship is hard to trace by using anonymity technology such as tor as a result totalitarian and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs and punish those who maintain them

in singapore two ethnic chinese individuals were imprisoned under the countrys antisedition law for posting antimuslim remarks in their blogs76 egyptian blogger kareem amer was charged with insulting the egyptian president hosni mubarak and an islamic institution through his blog it is the first time in the history of egypt that a blogger was prosecuted after a brief trial session that took place in alexandria the blogger was found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three years for insulting islam and inciting sedition and one year for insulting mubarak77 egyptian blogger abdel monem mahmoud was arrested in april 2007 for antigovernment writings in his blog monem is a member of the then banned muslim brotherhood after the 2011 egyptian revolution the egyptian blogger maikel nabil sanad was charged with insulting the military for an article he wrote on his personal blog and sentenced to three years78

personal safety
see also cyberstalking and internet homicide

articles are one form of written communication that a company may use to share information with its employees or customers articles might be written by marketing or public relations departments to communicate an organizations thought leadership while also providing relevant industry information

in this article we discuss how to write an article in seven steps and we offer noteworthy tips for writing an effective article

what is an article
an article is a written communication that portrays a central theme from a writer that they want to display to their readership article topics may vary and take showcase current or past events worldwide additionally the writer intends on writing content that draws a human interest and connects with viewers uniquely in comparison to other stories

other objectives a writer may aim to achieve when writing an article include

gives advice and courses of actions
drives exposure on newsworthy and technological stories
influences the current opinions of their readers
read more guide to okrs
how to write articles
review these guidelines for how to write an efficient article thats likely to be read by your target audience

select a topic to write about
identify your target audience
research facts that reinforce your story
come up with an outline of your article
write a rough draft and pare down your outline
specify your subject matter
read aloud until your draft is errorfree
read more what is a content management system
1 select a topic to write about
make a list of topics that you want to write about before you start writing this gives you the chance to find out what youre passionate about if youre writing an article for your company brainstorm ideas with the rest of your team to see which topic can evoke interest from potential customers you may need to communicate with your manager or executive team directly to get a better idea of the audience youre targeting however its recommended that you specify your article as soon as possible so you can begin writing and see if its the direction you want to take

2 identify your target audience
you need to take the viewpoint of the reader of your article to recognize the target audience youre trying to reach consider a swot analysis to see which audiences fit the content of the article youre writing

also take a look at these factors when searching for the right target audience

demographics this factor gives you a comprehensive look at an individuals age annual income geography and educational background for example you can target an article for women ages 18 to 35 living in the tristate area if you choose to write it on beauty products whereas you can target suburban men ages 35 to 54 on shaving products
behaviors and interests you want to know what type of content a reader is interested in so its important to study industry trends in marketing and advertising to see what types of people interact with their brands regardless of the fact theyre selling to them one example can be a company that generates a lot of foot traffic at sporting events for a cause knowing what motivates readers to take action provides with you key details on how you can solicit action from them
buying habits data on customer trends separate those seeking to purchase a product from those browsing the internet a company can employ targeted ads that persuade them to scroll back to their website so you may need to check in with your companys marketing team or check for customer trends articles online to see what can be a contributing factor to them consuming a product this way you may know what elements can be insightful to your audience and writes content that meshes with what they purchase
3 research facts that reinforce your story
having the facts is essential to writing a powerful story that captivates a reader you want to have a centralized area to keep your facts so you can assemble all the elements of your story in one place its suitable to have a notebook where you can write down ideas quickly but itll be easier for you to write notes digitally on a word processing document on your computer or smartphone

some examples of research you can gather include

statistics
quotes from sources related to the topic youre writing about
definitions regarding the topic of the article
short stories
references to pop culture or media
local or national events
resources that a user might find helpful
4 come up with an outline of your article
your article should have a basic format before you begin writing so you can spend more time on the content instead of the structure your resources can also aid you to come up with a format thats clear and understandable to the reader

the four main pieces of an outline that you should draw out should be

title the title is normally the one piece of an article that a viewer sees online when they look for content on their search engines make sure that you write content that targets the rich snippet at the top of the search engine result page serp to increase its viewership
intro paragraph the introductory paragraph introduces the main point of what youre trying to say about a topic this is the ideal method of attracting attention from your audience because youre exhibiting value that demonstrates why they should continue reading your piece
body paragraph the body paragraph allows you to construct and organize supporting information that backs up the point youre trying to make use examples from your research above to accentuate your topic and inform your audience about new information and why its impactful for them
conclusion the conclusion of your article can end with a call to action or something for the reader to consider in the future you want them to focus on the value they received from what they learned so they can tell others to read your content and share it with their network if youre writing for a company they can have a focus group make determinations on what they want to see next from the company which can be the driving force to the way you can end your article while enticing them to look forward to more meaningful content
5 write a rough draft and pare down your outline
you should write everything down first before you begin editing so you can unleash your creative process on paper you can edit everything after and reflect on what you can do differently to enhance the articles quality and which subjects you plan on elaborating on make sure that you start writing and editing from the top to the bottom of the article so you can save time on your first draft

6 specify your subject matter
break down the key points for each section of the outline so you can stay on track with your article you want to keep the readers eyes on your article at all times you should always be collaborating with an editor or internal member of your team if you have questions on content and where to expand on it

7 read aloud until your draft is errorfree
the last step is for you to read your article aloud multiple times before you submit it for approval you want to ensure thatll be concise and understood by the reader have a trusted friend or family member read it over to get honest feedback as well

read more what is strategic planning definition techniques and examples
tips for writing articles
consider these tips to help improve the content of the articles you write

check for punctuation and grammatical errors its important to proofread your articles for proper punctuation and grammatical usage also since articles for media publications generally follow ap style guidelines its useful to have an ap stylebook handy
time yourself when writing if you have a set word count write your first draft and see how long it takes you this is a great way to manage your time and write quality content on a steady basis while keeping your manager or editor informed about your progress
keep your points simple clarity is crucial for the success of your writing and you should get your point across with fewer words than writing more to meet a word requirement check with your manager or editor about the content guidelines and word count

welcome to wikipedia before starting a new article

please review wikipedias notability requirements in short the topic of an article must have already been the subject of publication in reliable secondary entirely independent sources that treat the topic in substantive detail they might be books newspapers magazines peerreviewed scholarly journals and similarly highquality websites
information on wikipedia must be verifiable if no reliable thirdparty sources can be found on a topic then it should not have a separate article
please search wikipedia first to make sure that an article does not already exist on the subject
generally an article should closely follow wikipedia policies and guidelines specially

neutral point of view
coverage of a notable topic
supported by reliable sources
an article wizard is available to help you create an article through the articles for creation process where it will be reviewed and considered for publication

article wizard
please consider looking at our introductory tutorial or reviewing contributing to wikipedia to learn the basics about editing working on existing articles is a good way to learn our protocols and style conventions see the task center for articles that need your assistance and tasks you can help out with

the basics
wikipedia is an encyclopedia written by volunteers to help people gain useful knowledge our encyclopedia is pretty comprehensive but that does not mean we would cover every single topic that exists therefore wikipedia is not a social media a place for promotion or advocacy nor a place to announce new unpublished theories information from websites blogs forum posts social media wikis including wikipedia and selfpublished sources are generally not suitable for wikipedia

in another way our job is to summarize such highquality and published sources from other places in the form of wikipedia articles that really is all we do do make sure that anything you write on wikipedia is based only on such sources

sounds easy not quite many of the notable topics have already been written by people in the past and the fact of the matter is most new articles nowadays are written about fairly obscure subjects that can make distinguishing topics that are suitable or not suitable on wikipedia very difficult and are often flashpoints for contentious disputes no amount of editing can overcome a lack of notability of a topic more than 200 articles are typically deleted from the english wikipedia every day most are deleted for this very reason we dont want you to waste all of your effort just for it to be marked for deletion

please avoid making an article that you have a conflict of interest in meaning that you have a close connection to the subject as an employee family member friend etc or your financial and other relationships this is a very strict policy on wikipedia conflicts of interest undermines public confidence and risks causing public embarrassment to the individuals and companies being promoted in practice articles created out of a conflict of interest are usually rejecteddeleted on sight further information helpyour first article  are you closely connected to the article topic

if you want to succeed at this endeavor you should gain ample of experience beforehand and get a feel of what a suitable topic to write on wikipedia would be in fact because the stakes are lower this is a perfect opportunity to hone your editing skills do take a tour through the tutorial ask around at the teahouse or read wikipediaarticle development dont feel ashamed if you couldnt find a new topic to write about wikipedia plenty of distinguished editors here have only edited existing articles but they are the one that turned the rubbish articles into great ones

before creating an article try to make sure there is not already an article on the same topic if you dont find a match perhaps try using a slightly different or broader search term tip if you want to write an article about a band member you might search for the band and then add information about your subject as a section within that broader article

main page wikipediareliable sources
before beginning to write any of your first article gather sources for the information you will be writing about you will use references to establish notability and to cite particular facts references used to establish notability must meet additional criteria beyond reliability references used for specific facts need not meet these additional criteria

to be suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia a subject must have significant coverage in multiple reliable independent sources all information in encyclopedia articles must be verifiable through citations

as noted the sources you use must be reliable they must be sources that exercise some form of editorial control and have some reputation for factchecking and accuracy print sources and webbased versions of those sources tend to be the most reliable examples include books published by major publishing houses newspapers magazines peerreviewed scholarly journals websites of any of the above and other websites that meet the same requirements as a reputable printbased source

in general sources with no editorial control are not reliable these include but are not limited to books published by vanity presses blogs web forums reddit discussions personal social media fan sites and other similar venues if anyone at all can post information without anyone else checking that information it is probably not reliable similarly an opinion column in an otherwise reputable newspaper cannot help establish notability

many web sources feature usergenerated content this anyone can sign up and create content all wikis are like this including wikipedia also imdb goodreads youtube linkedin and social media such as twitter and instagram except for a few specific exceptions these sources cannot be used

a good resource for determining the quality of a source is wprsp this does not list things like books or extremely reputable sources which are never questioned like the associated press it does list many sources that have been debated frequently if your source is listed on that page as generally unreliable or deprecated you should not use it in your article

sources used to establish notability must additionally be independent they must not be connected to the subject a companys own website cannot help establish notability an interview with someone cannot help establish notability as these can be bought a press release repackaged as a news item churnalism cannot help either and is sometimes more difficult to spot articles in forbes magazine whose author is listed as a forbes contributor are the equivalent of an opinion column usually paid for by a business or individual with the intent of selfpromotion

sources used to establish notability must additionally demonstrate significant coverage they must discuss your subject for awhile at least multiple paragraphs a mention in one or two sentences or the appearance of your subject in a table or list is not enough to help establish notability

sources that are not independent of the subject or do not demonstrate significant coverage can still be used in your article to support factual claims but do not count towards notability sources that are not reliable should not be used at all

if there are reliable independent sources such as newspapers journals or books with extensive information published over an extended period about a subject then that subject is notable you must cite such sources as part of the process of creating a wikipedia article as evidence of notability for evaluation by other editors if you cannot find such reliable sources that provide extensive information about your proposed subject then the subject is not notable or verifiable and almost certainly will be declined or deleted

if none of your sources are reliable and independent while providing significant coverage it doesnt matter how many you have no amount of these is enough to establish notability adding many inadequate sources will not help your article get approved and will delay review as reviewers struggle to check them all

so your first job is to go find sources to cite there are many places to find reliable sources including your local library but if internetbased sources are to be used start with books and news archive searches rather than a web search

once you have references for your article you can learn to place the references into the article by reading helpreferencing for beginners and wikipediaciting sources if you are using the visual editor it can automatically generate citations for you if you tap the quotation mark icon and feed it a link to a webpage please double check these as they sometimes contain errors or lack important information such as author and publication date you can toggle between the visual and source editors by tapping the pencil  eyeball icon in the upper right corner of the editing area

things to avoid
shortcut
wpavoidcreate
main pages wikipediawhat wikipedia is not and wikipediaavoiding common mistakes
articles about yourself your family or friends your website a band youre in your teacher etc
if you or someone or something you are personally involved with is suitable for inclusion in the encyclopedia let someone else add that article you will have to ignore all your own knowledge and all your own feelings in order to create an article that is appropriately sourced and neutral
advertising and promotion
please do not try to promote your product or business please do not post external links to your commercial website we do have articles about notable products and businesses but if you are writing about a product or business be sure you write from a neutral point of view that you have no conflict of interest and that you are able to find references in reliable sources that are independent from the subject you are writing about for a business or similar organization make sure it meets the specific notability guidelines for businesses and read the faq for nonprofits and forprofit businesses an article will be considered promotional if it describes its subject in wholly positive terms or uses excessive puffery even if it is not an overt advertisement keep in mind that if you or your business or a product or friend you care about has a wikipedia article you will not be able to control its contents negative material may appear there if it is appropriate to add from an encyclopedic perspective an article about yourself is not necessarily a good thing please dont write an article about yourself focus your brand building on platforms where you control the messaging and when you eventually qualify for an encyclopedia article someone else will write one
attacks on a person or organization
material that violates our biographies of living persons policy or is intended to threaten defame or harass its subject or another entity is not permitted unsourced negative information especially in articles about living people is quickly removed and attack pages may be deleted immediately
personal essays or original research
wikipedia surveys existing human knowledge it is not a place to publish new work do not write articles that present your own original theories opinions or insights even if you can support them by reference to accepted work a common mistake is to present a novel synthesis of ideas in an article
nonnotable topics
people frequently add pages to wikipedia without considering whether the topic is really notable enough to go into an encyclopedia wikipedia includes articles on many topics but not every topic a particularly common special case of this is articles about people companies or groups of people that do not establish notability through significant coverage in reliable independent sources notability is not the same as popularity success or fame there are many successful entrepreneurs wealthy businesses wellknown scholars bestselling books and popular media personalities with no encyclopedia article wikipedia is not a directory of everything in existence
things from the future
a film that has not been released yet a sports season that has yet to begin or a book that has not yet been published are all examples of topics that may be suitable for an encyclopedia article in the future but not yet wikipedia cannot see the future
a single sentence or only a website link
articles need to have real content of their own short articles  called stubs  are welcome but the article content should be at least several sentences a good rule of thumb is if you cannot find ten separate facts about your topic in your sources there might not be enough information for a standalone article
see also wikipedialist of bad article ideas
and be careful about
copyright
as a general rule do not copypaste text from other websites there are a few limited exceptions and a few words as part of a properly cited and clearly attributed quotation is ok

 wikipediacopypaste
copying things do not violate copyrights
never copypaste text into a wikipedia article unless it is a relatively short quotation placed in quotation marks and cited using an inline citation even material that you are sure is in the public domain must be attributed to the source or the result while not a copyright violation is plagiarism for more information see wikipediacopyrights which includes instructions for verifying permission to copy previously published text and our nonfree content guidelines for text material that violates copyright will be deleted very quickly and you will lose all your progress and have to start over superficial modification of material such as minor rewording is insufficient to avoid plagiarism and copyright violations see wikipediaclose paraphrasing
good sources
1 have a reputation for reliability they are reliable sources
2 are independent of the subject
3 are verifiable by other editors

good research and citing your sources
please research with the best sources available and cite them properly summarize what they say in your own words to avoid any possibility of plagiarism do not use ai programs like chatgpt to compose text or to verify information these are not reliable and can make things up
add citations as you write
adding a citation to each important statement as you write the article is much easier and quicker than the opposite where you write the article and then try to find sources to verify the information you added this is called writing articles backward
articles or statements about living persons
as with all topics articles written about living persons must be referenced so that they can be verified this requirement is enforced far more rigorously for any statements about a living or recently deceased person and reviewers are supposed to remove immediately any unreferenced material before discussing add your references as you write the article to avoid this immediate removal
advocacy and controversial material
please do not write articles that advocate one particular viewpoint on politics religion or anything else understand what we mean by a neutral point of view before tackling this sort of topic
assuming your subject is notable because of similar articles
wikipedias quality control has increased over time there are old articles that were created when standards were lower that would no longer be considered acceptable today the existence of these articles does not mean we should approve more articles that do not meet current standards instead the old unsuitable articles should be improved or removed also there are many wikipedias in other languages and the english wikipedia has the strictest standards for inclusion if your subject has an article in a different language wikipedia that is not a guarantee of inclusion in the english wikipedia the only sure criterion for inclusion is significant coverage in reliable independent sources these sources do not need to be in english
articles that contain different definitions of the topic
articles are primarily about what something is not any terms if the article is just about a word or phrase and especially if there are very different ways that a term is used it usually belongs in wiktionary instead try to write a good short first paragraph that defines one subject as well as some more material to go with it
localinterest articles
these are articles about places such as schools or streets that are of interest to a relatively small number of people such as alumni or people who live nearby there is no consensus about such articles but some will challenge them if they include nothing that shows how the place is special and different from tens of thousands of similar places photographs add interest try to give localinterest articles local colour thirdparty sources are the only way to prove that the subject you are writing about is notable
breaking news events
while wikipedia accepts articles about notable recent events articles about breaking news events with no enduring notability are not appropriate for our project
are you closely connected to the article topic
main page wikipediaconflict of interest
wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit but there are special guidelines for editors who are paid or sponsored these guidelines are intended to prevent biased articles and maintain the publics trust that content in wikipedia is impartial and has been added in good faith

the official guideline is that editors should be volunteers that means wikipedia discourages editing articles about individuals companies organizations productsservices or political causes that pay you directly or indirectly this includes inhouse pr departments and marketing departments other company employees public relations firms and publicists socialmedia consultants and online reputation management consultants however wikipedia recognizes the large volume of goodfaith contributions by people who have some affiliation to the articles they work on

here are some ground rules note that this is not necessarily a full list so use common sense when applying these rules if you break these rules or game the system your edits are likely to be reverted and the articles and your other edits may get extra scrutiny from other wikipedia editors your account may also be blocked

things to avoid	things to be careful about	great ways to contribute
dont add promotional language
dont remove negative or critical text from an article
dont make a group account for multiple people to share
dont neglect to disclose your affiliation on the articles talk page
maintain a neutral objective tone in any content you add or edit
cite independent reliable sources eg a major media article for any new statements you add  even if you are confident a statement is true eg it is about your work make a statement only if it has been already published in a reliable source
make minor editscorrections to articles eg typos fixing links adding references to reliable sources
if you are biased suggest new article text or edits on the article talk page not on the main article page
disclose your relationship to the clienttopic
edit using personal accounts
recruit help seek out a sponsor volunteer editor who has worked on similar articles or submit ideas for article topics via requested articles
note that this only covers conflicts of interest editors are encouraged to write on topics related to their expertise eg a nasa engineer might write about jupiter or an english professor might write about mark twain also wikipediansinresidence or other interns who are paid hosted or otherwise sponsored by a scientific or cultural institution can upload content and write articles in partnership with curators indirectly providing positive branding for their hosts

create your draft
for an alternative way of creating a new wikipedia article without creating a draft first see wikipediahow to create a page
its always a good idea to draft your article before adding it to the main article space and its required for very new contributors the article wizard will guide you through the steps of creating a draft

prior to drafting your article its a good idea to look at several existing wikipedia articles on subjects similar to yours to see how such articles are formatted the quality of our existing articles varies so try to pick good ones many wikipedia articles have been assessed for quality which can be checked on the articles talk page if an article has been assessed as bclass or as a good article or featured article it is safe to use as an organizational template for your article you can also consult wikipedias manual of style to see how articles are supposed to be structured

gather your sources summarizing what they say in your own words adding citations as you go clearly establish your subjects notability disclose any applicable conflict of interest adhere to a neutral point of view and write in an encyclopedic tone

article wizard
when you feel that the article is ready you can submit it for review by an experienced editor if there isnt already a submit for review button on the draft you can add substsubmit to the top of the draft to submit it a reviewer will then look at your draft and move it to the main article space or give you feedback on how to improve it you can always edit the page even while waiting for a review this may take a long time there may be additional delay if your sources are not written in english nonenglish sources are fine but many of us cannot read them to verify the statements in your article please have patience we are all volunteers

autoconfirmed users can publish their drafts to mainspace as wikipedia articles via a pagemove as explained in wikipediadrafts#publishing a draft

keep making improvements
wikipedia is not finished generally an article is nowhere near being completed the moment it is created there is a long way to go in fact it may take you several edits just to get it started

if you have so much interest in the article you just created you may learn more about it in the future and accordingly have more to add this may be later today tomorrow or several months from now any time  go ahead

improve formatting
to format your article correctly and expand it and possibly even make it featured see

wikipediatutorial to learn how to format your article
wikipediawriting better articles
wikipediathe perfect article
wikipedialead section
others can freely contribute to the article when it has been saved the creator does not have special rights to control the later content see wikipediaownership of articles

also to avoid getting frustrated or offended about the way others modify or remove your contributions see wikipediadont be ashamed

avoid orphans
an orphaned article is an article that has few or no other articles linking to it the main problem with an orphan is that itll be unknown to others and it may get fewer readers if it is not deorphaned make sure there are incoming links to the new article from other wikipedia articles click what links here in the toolbox and that the new article is included in at least one appropriate category see helpcategory otherwise it will be difficult for readers to find the article

most new articles are orphans from the moment they are created but you can work to change that this will involve editing one or more other articles try searching wikipedia for other pages referring to the subject of your article then turn those references into links by adding double brackets to either side  and  if another article has a word or phrase that has the same meaning as your new article that is not expressed using the exact same words as the title you can link that word or phrase as follows title of your new article|word or phrase found in other article in certain cases you could create that word or phrase as a redirect to your new article

one of the first things you want to do after creating a new article is to provide links to it so it will not be an orphan you can do that right away or if you find that exhausting you can wait a while provided that you keep the task in mind

see wikipediadrawing attention to new pages to learn how to get others to see your new articles

add to a disambiguation page
if the term is ambiguous meaning there are multiple pages using that or a similar title see if there is a disambiguation page for articles bearing that title if so add a link to your article to that page

still need help
help desk
for a list of informative instructional and supportive pages see help directory
the best places to ask for assistance are at the teahouse and at the main help desk
click here to ask for help on your talk page a volunteer will visit you there shortly
for a list of the services and assistance that can be requested on wikipedia see request departments
alternately you can ask a question through the wikipedia #wikipediaenhelp connect on irc chat
wiki education offers a library of trainings for novice wikipedia editors and students
read a traditional encyclopedia
read good or featured articles on wikipedia to get the layout style tone and other elements of encyclopedic content traditional paper encyclopedias like the world book are also good influences encyclopedia britannica is a good example of an online general purpose encyclopedia encyclopdia iranica is a specialist online encyclopedia but also a good example it is suggested that if you plan to write articles for an encyclopedia you have some background knowledge in formal writing as well as about the topic at hand a composition class in your high school or college is recommended before you start writing encyclopedia articles

article review
an article review format allows scholars or students to analyze and evaluate the work of other experts in a given field outside of the education system experts often review the work of their peers for clarity originality and contribution to the discipline of study

when answering the questions of what is an article review and how to write one you must understand the depth of analysis and evaluation that your instructor is seeking

what is an article review
that is a type of professional paper writing which demands a high level of indepth analysis and a wellstructured presentation of arguments it is a critical constructive evaluation of literature in a particular field through summary classification analysis and comparison

if you write a scientific review you have to use database searches to portray the research your primary goal is to summarize everything and present a clear understanding of the topic youve been working on

writing involves

summarization classification analysis critiques and comparison
the analysis evaluation and comparison require use theories ideas and research relevant to the subject area of the article
it is also worth nothing if a review does not introduce new information but instead presents a response to another writers work
check out other samples to gain a better understanding of how to review the article
types of review
there are few types of article reviews

journal article review
much like all other reviews a journal article review evaluates strengths and weaknesses of a publication a qualified paper writer must provide the reader with an analysis and interpretation that demonstrates the articles value

research article review
it differs from a journal article review by the way that it evaluates the research method used and holds that information in retrospect to analysis and critique

science article review
scientific article review involves anything in the realm of science often scientific publications include more information on the background that you can use to analyze the publication more comprehensively

need an article review written
just send us the requirements to your paper and watch one of our writers crafting an original paper for you

write my paper for me
formatting an article review
the format of the article should always adhere to the citation style required by your professor if youre not sure seek clarification on the preferred format and ask him to clarify several other pointers to complete the formatting of an article review adequately

how many publications should you review
in what format you should cite your articles mla apa asa chicago etc
what length should your review be
should you include a summary critique or personal opinion in your assignment
do you need to call attention to a theme or central idea within the articles
does your instructor require background information
when you know the answers to these questions you may start writing your assignment below are examples of mla and apa formats as those are the two most common citation styles

articlereview
using the apa format
articles appear most commonly in academic journals newspapers and websites if you write an article review in the apa format you will need to write bibliographical entries for the sources you use

web author last name aa first and middle initial year month date of publication title retrieved from link
journal author last name aa first and middle initial publication year publication title periodical title volumeissue pppp
newspaper author last name aa first and middle initial year month date of publication publication title magazine title pp xxxx
using mla format
web last first middle initial publication title website title website publisher date month year published web date month year accessed
newspaper last first m publication title newspaper title city date month year published pages print
journal last first m publication title journal title series volume issue year published pages database name web date month year accessed
the prewriting process
facing this task for the first time can really get confusing and can leave you being unsure where to begin to create a topnotch article review start with a few preparatory steps here are the two main stages to get you started

step 1 define the right organization for your review knowing the future setup of your paper will help you define how you should read the article here are the steps to follow

summarize the article  seek out the main points ideas claims and general information presented in the article
define the positive points  identify the strong aspects ideas and insightful observations the author has made
find the gaps  determine whether or not the author has any contradictions gaps or inconsistencies in the article and evaluate whether or not he or she used a sufficient amount of arguments and information to support his or her ideas
identify unanswered questions  finally identify if there are any questions left unanswered after reading the piece
step 2 move on and review the article here is a small and simple guide to help you do it right

start off by looking at and assessing the title of the piece its abstract introductory part headings and subheadings opening sentences in its paragraphs and its conclusion
first read only the beginning and the ending of the piece introduction and conclusion these are the parts where authors include all of their key arguments and points therefore if you start with reading these parts it will give you a good sense of the authors main points
finally read the article fully
these three steps make up most of the prewriting process after you are done with them you can move on to writing your own reviewand we are going to guide you through the writing process as well

organization in an assignment like this is of utmost importance before embarking on your writing process you could outline your assignment or use an article review template to organize your thoughts more coherently

outline and template
as you progress with reading your article organize your thoughts into coherent sections in an outline as you read jot down important facts contributions or contradictions identify the shortcomings and strengths of your publication begin to map your outline accordingly

if your professor does not want a summary section or a personal critique section then you must alleviate those parts from your writing much like other assignments an article review must contain an introduction a body and a conclusion thus you might consider dividing your outline according to these sections as well as subheadings within the body if you find yourself troubled with the prewriting and the brainstorming process for this assignment seek out a sample outline

your custom essay must contain these constituent parts

pretitle page here you will want to list the type of the article that you are reviewing the title of the publication all the authors who contributed to it authors affiliations position department institute city state country email id
optional corresponding author details name address phone number email and fax number
running head only in the apa format it is the title of your paper shortened to less than 40 characters
summary page optional depending on the demands of your instructor the summary should be maximum 800 words long use nontechnical and straightforward language do not repeat text verbatim or give references in this section give 1 relevant background 2 explain why the work was done 3 summarize results and explain the method
title page full title 250word abstract followed by keywords and 46 keywords
introduction
body include headings and subheadings
works citedreferences
optional suggested reading page
tables and figure legends if instructed by the professor

proceed to order
steps for writing an article review
here is a guide with critique paper format from our research paper writing service on how to write a review paper

stepsforwritingartclereview
step 1 write the title
first of all you need to write a title that reflects the main focus of your work respectively the title can be either interrogative descriptive or declarative

step 2 cite the article
next create a proper citation for the reviewed article and input it following the title at this step the most important thing to keep in mind is the style of citation specified by your instructor in the requirements for the paper for example an article citation in the mla style should look as follows

authors last and first name the title of the article journals title and issuepublication date pages print

example

abraham john the world of dreams virginia quarterly 6021991 12567 print
step 3 article identification
after your citation you need to include the identification of your reviewed article

title of the article
author
title of the journal
year of publication
all of this information should be included in the first paragraph of your paper

example

the report poverty increases school dropouts was written by brian faith  a health officer  in 2000
step 4 introduction
your organization in an assignment like this is of the utmost importance before embarking on your writing process you should outline your assignment or use an article review template to organize your thoughts coherently

if you are wondering how to start an article review begin with an introduction that mentions the article and your thesis for the review
follow up with a summary of the main points of the article
highlight the positive aspects and facts presented in the publication
critique the publication through identifying gaps contradictions disparities in the text and unanswered questions
step 5 summarize the article
make a summary of the article by revisiting what the author has written about note any relevant facts and findings from the article include the authors conclusions in this section

step 6 critique it
present the strengths and weaknesses you have found in the publication highlight the knowledge that the author has contributed to the field also write about any gaps andor contradictions you have found in the article take a standpoint of either supporting or not supporting the authors assertions but back up your arguments with facts and relevant theories that are pertinent to that area of knowledge rubrics and templates can also be used to evaluate and grade the person who wrote the article

step 7 craft a conclusion
in this section revisit the critical points of your piece your findings in the article and your critique also write about the accuracy validity and relevance of the results of the article review present a way forward for future research in the field of study before submitting your article keep these pointers in mind

as you read the article highlight the key points this will help you pinpoint the articles main argument and the evidence that they used to support that argument
while you write your review use evidence from your sources to make a point this is best done using direct quotations
select quotes and supporting evidence adequately and use direct quotations sparingly take time to analyze the article adequately
every time you reference a publication or use a direct quotation use a parenthetical citation to avoid accidentally plagiarizing your article
reread your piece a day after you finish writing it this will help you to spot grammar mistakes and to notice any flaws in your organization
use a spellchecker and get a second opinion on your paper

finally when all of the parts of your article review are set and ready you have one last thing to take care of  proofreading although students often neglect this step proofreading is a vital part of the writing process and will help you polish your paper to ensure that there are no mistakes or inconsistencies

remember you can skip around this article to the parts that are most useful from your point of view first were starting with the what behind the how

what is a howto article
refreshingly the name doesnt leave much to the imagination

a howto article lays out exactly how to do something a howto blogger might walk readers through how to buy use or troubleshoot a product or focus on a wider more general topic instead like how to bake a chocolate cake

what sets a howto article apart from the rest of the content on the internet is user intent people clicking on howto guides arent necessarily looking for info around what a topic is or why they should be interested they already know and they already are  your job is to show them how

how to write a howto article in 8 simple steps
a good article should provide practical and clear takeaways that the reader can put into practice they should avoid jargon and be made up of a list with easytofollow steps and bullet points in chronological order

choose a topic
put yourself in the audiences shoes
research keywords
plan your articles structure
keep your steps snappy and straightforward
give your guide a unique selling point
set your page up for seo success
monitor your pages metrics  and keep optimizing
lets start with step one

1 choose a topic
the logics infallible  you cant begin writing a howto article if you dont know what youre going to be writing about so first youll need to select a topic

the topic you pick will depend on what you want to achieve your industry and target audience

you might for instance be a company that sells a fairly technical product so youd want to publish an article that offers honed specific advice as to how to use it in this case the howto guide services a specific business need  educating the customer in this case the topic will be dictated by your product catalog for example

how to assemble an ikea kallax
how to set up a samsung neo tv
how to use an amazon echo
at the opposite end of the spectrum you could be publishing a howto content offering additional tips around a more general subject such as

how to blow up a balloon
how to defrost a chicken
how to change a lightbulb
in the case of these examples youre probably writing the content either to build your brand or make money via display ads or affiliate marketing

but still  that doesnt mean your choice of topic for your howto article should be random you should always pick topics that fit within your particular niche or industry how to blow up a balloon for instance is a great choice of topic for a party supplies website  but not for one specializing in digital marketing

so think carefully about what you want to write about if it ties into your brands sector and niche its good
if it addresses a direct business or customer need its great and if you have experience with the topic  and are passionate about writing it  its even better

2 put yourself in the audiences shoes
now youve chosen what youre going to write about youll need to figure out who youre writing for youll have to start thinking like your target audience  that is the people who will read your howto guide  and tailor the content accordingly

to craft quality content ask yourself a few questions

what are their pain points
what do they already know
what new information can i offer
what knowledge gaps are they expecting this article to plug
even better you can use audience analysis tools like similarweb research intelligence to dig into the data on this foundation you can start building up a comprehensive user profile of your articles intended audience thisll then lead to more advanced considerations like

what other sites do they frequent
what topics or products do they search for online
what is the best channel to promote this content for my audience ie social media email ppc organic etc
what demographics are my readers location age etc
knowing your audience is crucial for striking the right balance when it comes to your articles tone content and technicality

an article entitled how to build a model airplane for instance shouldnt alienate the beginners among its readership with overly complicated terminology similarly how to deal with a breakup should adopt a more compassionate conciliatory tone

3 research keywords
now that you know your topic and your audience youll need to find the right keywords  particularly if you have any aspirations to get said audiences eyes on your howto article organically

keywords are words and phrases that people enter into search engines like google and youtube to find what theyre looking for online heres an example using similarweb keyword research tool found related keywords to how to blow up a balloon

similarweb keyword generator shows the top related keywords to how to blow up a balloon
now you can see what are the related keywords and questions to get more ideas while brainstorming the sections to include in your piece you can also select secondary keywords to rank using the trending keywords filter

in this case the root keyword balloons shows that birthday balloons and balloons online are both very strong terms to include

similarweb keyword generator shows the top trending keywords related to the term balloons
once youve identified the primary and secondary keywords youre hoping to rank for you are ready to create your outline

4 plan your article structure
the order in which you write your article is completely up to you you can start with the first paragraph or fill out your steps and main points before tackling the introduction and faqs

but whichever angle you come at your howto article from theres one thing youll need in place before your first draft  a structure

heres what we recommend

similarweb template detailing how to plan your article structure

keep the howto structure guide
for a more detailed deep dive into what content headings tips faqs and ctas you need to include in your piece i recommend downloading our howto article template

pro tip to take your howto article to the next level create a short video covering the main steps you go over not only can this increase engagement with your article but it can help more people find you on youtube

5 keep your steps snappy and straightforward
remember no ones here for an essay so make sure that each step of your article says what it needs to without ever becoming overlong or bogged down in detail less is more being clear and concise and engaging is key to keeping your target audience engaged and coming back for more
moving on

6 give your howto guide a unique selling point
remember people learn in different ways some will be readers while others will prefer to absorb information via watching listening or engaging in handson interaction

with that in mind be sure not to load your howto article up with too much copy break up those text walls with videos infographics tables music or quizzes instead trust us  its not just the visual learners in your audience thatll thank us

plus there are plenty of other ways to bestow a unique selling point upon your content you can for instance give your article a special angle or hook for instance

is your guide stepbystep or nononsense
does it offer everything you need to know or is it simply the ultimate guide to the subject matter
would you brand it for beginners or for those with a more advanced understanding
case studies top tips and expert comments  which you can source from pr databases such as response source or help a reporter out  are also great ways of infusing your howto article with unique valueadding and original quality content

7 set your page up for seo success
you wouldnt spend a night out on the snowy tundras of alaska without bundling up warm

so before you push your article out into the unforgiving wilderness of googles search engine results pages serps youll need to arm it with all the gear it needs to survive  and thrive  in an online environment

now you already started equipping your howto article for seo survival when you researched relevant seo keywords using our keyword research tool and integrated them naturally into your copy but before you hit publish youll want to make sure youve got the rest of the basics downpat too

include the keywords you found in the page content
ensure your page has valuedriven meta titles and descriptions with the right character count  about 60 for the title and 160 for the description
link to other thematically relevant pages on your site as well as external sources that will elevate user experience
compress any images on your page to reduce their file size and drive down the amount of time your howto article takes to load
and thats just the onpage stuff there are so many more factors  from the layout and speed of your website to its linking structure and backlink profile  thatll affect how your page performs

for more seo tips skip down to the dedicated section on it below or check out our comprehensive guide to creating an seo strategy

and please dont forget to proofread before you press publish

8 monitor your page metrics  and keep optimizing
congratulations  your page is live all that planning research penmanship and seoing has furnished you with a howto article worthy of toptier serp real estate

but alas  the work doesnt stop there

now begins the perpetual process of study evaluation and iteration that comes with being the proud author of web content

among the metrics youll want to keep tabs on are

session duration can you increase this with a video or infographic
bounce rate can you reduce this with a more engaging introduction
page views can you boost these organically or with paid advertising
ultimately theres always something you can do to make a page better so test tinker and never be afraid to experiment  thats how breakthroughs are made

how to optimize your howto page for seo
we touched on the basics in step 7 but  for your howto article to really get a tune out of googles rankings  youll want to dabble in the following

marking up your page with howto schema
in the words of google structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content

in the words of the layman its code that makes it explicitly clear to google that your article is a howto guide specifically  and not some other piece of content with a contrasting intent

adding this schema to your page will also help optimize it for voice searches  such as those made through apple siri or amazon alexa  and assist google in extracting your articles rich media and showcasing it in the serps pictured

structured data can be added with code or a programming language such as javascript or  if you use a content management system  via a plugin head to googles guide to adding structured data for more info

write conversationally
this piece of advice is to help you avoid one of the most common mistakes too much jargon you wont find the key to writing good web copy in the thesaurus  so drop the big words the long sentences and the unnecessary wordiness

instead write conversationally  that is in a way that reflects how you actually speak and how your readers will read and interpret your content address your readers as you ask questions use the active voice and use analogies and storytelling to forge a connection with your audience

in addition to helping your reader empathize with you  and understand your content  conversational copy and specifically copy that is readable is thought to be preferred by users and google and will also help your article rank for voice searches after all when people are saying their inquiries to google  rather than typing them out  they tend to search as theyd speak

eat why the author matters
eat stands for expertise authority and trustworthiness its one of the factors google uses to rate the overall quality of a howto article and is tied specifically to the contents creator  in this case you

eat content is a high level of expertise authoritativeness and trustworthiness
here googles looking to understand three core elements about you as an author

expertise are you an established expert in the topic what kind of experience do you have in the field
authority do you  and the site youre publishing on  have recognized authority in the space is the content youre writing original
trustworthiness are you trustworthy have you checked your sources do you rely on expert knowledge why should google rank your content
so if you have all the right credentials to be talking about your topic dont hold back include a bio of yourself with your howto article explaining your experience and motivations and reaffirming why joe public and google alike should trust you

equally  if you dont have that standing just yet  dont fret you can build up your eat by

accruing and responding to user reviews

how to write an article
how to write an article
the craft of article writing
writing is a complex skill a very complex skill

not only do we put students under pressure to master the inconsistent spelling patterns and complex grammar of the english language but we require them to know how to write for a variety of purposes in both fiction and nonfiction genres

on top of this writing is just one aspect of one subject among many

the best way to help our students to overcome the challenge of writing in any genre is to help them to break things down into their component parts and give them a basic formula to follow

in this article we will break article writing down into its components and present a formulaic approach that will provide a basic structure for our students to follow

once this structure is mastered students can of course begin to play with things

but until then there is plenty of room within the discipline of the basic structure for students to express themselves in the article form

what is an article
how to write an articlearticle writing | different articles 1 | how to write an article | literacyideascom
the cambridge dictionary defines an article as a piece of writing on a particular subject in a newspaper or magazine or on the internet

an articles shape and structure will vary depending on whether its intended for publication in a newspaper magazine or online

each of these media has its own requirements for example a magazine feature article may go into great depth on a topic allowing for long evocative paragraphs of exposition while an online blog article may be full of lots of short paragraphs that get to the point without too much fanfare

each of these forms makes different demands on the writer and its for this reason that most newspapers magazines and big websites provide writers with specific submission guidelines

so with such diverse demands placed on article writers how do we go about teaching the diverse skill required to our students

luckily we can break most types of articles down into some common key features

below well take a look at the most important of these along with an activity to get your students practicing each aspect right away

finally well take a look at a few general tips on article writing

key written features of an article
the headline
the purpose of the headline is to capture the readers attention and let them know what the article is about all of this in usually no more than 4 or 5 words

there is an art to good headline writing and all sorts of literary devices eg alliteration and metaphor can be used to create an eyecatching and intriguing headline

the best way for students to learn how headlines work is to view some historical samples

newspaper headlines especially are known for being short and pithy here are just a few examples to whet the appetite

hitler is dead
lincoln shot
men walk on the moon
berlin wall crumbles
you could encourage students to find some pithy examples of their own its amazing how much information can be condensed into so few words  this is the essence of good headline writing

headlines practice activity
give students opportunities to practice headline writing in isolation from article writing itself for example take sample stories from newspapers and magazines and challenge students to write new headlines for them set a word limit appropriate to the skills and age of the students for example younger more inexperienced students might write 9word headlines while older more skilled students might thrive with the challenge of a 4word limit

the subheading
subheadings give the reader more information on what the article is about for this reason theyre often a little longer than headlines and use a smaller font though still larger or in bold than the font used in the body of the text

subheadings provide a little more of the necessary detail to inform readers whats going on if a headline is a jab the subheading is the cross

in magazines and online articles especially there are often subheadings throughout the article in this context they let the reader know what each paragraphsection is about

subheadings also help the readers eye to scan the article and quickly get a sense of the story for the writer they help immensely to organize the structure of the story

practice activity
one way to help organize paragraphs in an article is to use parallel structure

parallel structure is when we use similar words phrases and grammar structures we might see this being used in a series of subheadings in a how to article where the subheadings all start with an imperative such as choose attach cut etc

have you noticed how all the sections in this key features part of this article start simply with the word the this is another example of a parallel structure

yet another example of parallel structure is when all the subheadings appear in the form of a question

whichever type of parallel structure students use they need to be sure that they all in some way relate to the original title of the article

to give students a chance to practice writing subheadings using parallel structure instruct them to write subheadings for a piece of text that doesnt already have them

the body paragraphs
writing good solid paragraphs is an art in itself luckily youll find comprehensive guidance on this aspect of writing articles elsewhere on this site

but for now lets take a look at some general considerations for students when writing articles

the length of the paragraphs will depend on the medium for example for online articles paragraphs are generally brief and to the point usually no more than a sentence or two and rarely more than five

this style is often replicated in newspapers and magazines of a more tabloid nature

short paragraphs allow for more white space on the page or screen this is much less daunting for the reader and makes it easier for them to focus their attention on whats being said  a crucial advantage in these attentionhungry times

lots of white space makes articles much more readable on devices with smaller screens such as phones and tablets chunking information into brief paragraphs enables online readers to scan articles more quickly too which is how much of the information on the internet is consumed  i do hope youre not scanning this

conversely articles that are written more formally for example academic articles can benefit from longer paragraphs which allow for more space to provide supporting evidence for the topic sentence

deciding on the length of paragraphs in an article can be done by first thinking about the intended audience the purpose of the article as well as the nature of the information to be communicated

practice activity
a fun activity to practice paragraphing is to organize your students into groups and provide them with a copy of an article with the original paragraph breaks removed in their groups students read the article and decide on where they think the paragraphs should go

to do this successfully theyll need to consider the type of publication they think the article is intended for the purpose of the article the language level and the nature of the information

when the groups have finished adding in their paragraph breaks they can share and compare their decisions with the other groups before you finally reveal where the breaks were in the original article

article photos and captions
how to write an articlearticle writing | article images | how to write an article | literacyideascom
photos and captions arent always necessary in articles but when they are our students must understand how to make the most of them

just like the previous key features on our list there are specific things students need to know to make the most of this specific aspect of article writing

photos
the internet has given us the gift of access to innumerable copyrightfree images to accompany our articles but what criteria should students use when choosing an image

to choose the perfect accompanying images for their article students need to identify images that match the tone of their article

quirky or risque images wont match the more serious tone of an academic article well but they might work perfectly for that feature of tattoo artists

photos are meant to bring value to an article  they speak a thousand words after all its important then that the image is of a high enough resolution that the detail of those thousand words is clearly visible to the reader

captions
just as the tone of the photo should match the tone of the article the tone of the caption should match the tone of the photo

captions should be informative and engaging often the first thing a reader will look at in an article is the photos and then the caption frequently theyll use the information therein to decide whether or not theyll continue to read

when writing captions students must avoid redundancy they need to add information to that which is already available to the reader by looking at the image

theres no point merely describing in words what the reader can clearly see with their own two eyes students should describe things that are not immediately obvious such as date location or the name of the event

one last point captions should be written in the present tense by definition the photo will show something that has happened already despite this students should write as if the action in the image is happening right now

remind students that their captions should be brief they must be careful not to waste words with such a tight format

practice activity

for this fun activity youll need some old magazines and newspapers cut some of the photos out minus their captions all the accompanying captions should be cut out and jumbled up its the students job to match each image with the correct accompanying caption

students can present their decisions and explanations when theyve finished

a good extension exercise would be to challenge the students to write a superior caption for each of the images theyve worked on

top 5 tips for article writing
now your students have the key features of article writing sewn up tightly lets take a look at a few quick and easy tips to help them polish up their general article writing skills

1 read widely  reading widely all manner of articles is the best way students can internalize some of the habits of good article writing luckily with the internet its easy to find articles on any topic of interest at the click of a mouse

2 choose interesting topics  its hard to engage the reader when the writer is not themselves engaged be sure students choose article topics that pique their own interest as far as possible

3 research and outline  regardless of the type of article the student is writing some research will be required the research will help an article take shape in the form of an outline without these two crucial stages articles run the danger of wandering aimlessly and worse still of containing inaccurate information and details

4 keep things simple  all articles are about communicating information in one form or another the most effective way of doing this is to keep things easily understood by the reader this is especially true when the topic is complex

5 edit and proofread  this can be said of any type of writing but it still bears repeating students need to ensure they comprehensively proofread and edit their work when theyve finished the importance of this part of the writing process cant be overstated

and to conclude

what is an article in the newspaper

some would say that it is a dying art with the availability of the internet millions of people can get the news at their fingertips so why do we need the papers delivered to our doorstep now well it is certainly true that the internet has become a gamechanger but people are always required to be informed and the newspaper has long served the need

the written news may be changing but it will always be important in our society the rest of this lesson discusses how to write an article in the style of a physical newspaper

well a news article discusses the current recent news of common interest ie daily newspaper or a specific topic ie political or business news magazines club newspapers or technology news websites a news article may include eyewitness accounts of the incident

how do you write a newspaper article

the best way to structure a newspaper article is to first write an outline review your research and notes then jot down the ideas for the following six sections remember this is just a foundation on which you can build your story

how do you write a news article headline

headline this is a brief noticeable statement about the incident the title of your article should be attractive and up to the point you should puncture your title using associated press style guidelines which specify for example that the first word is capitalized but unlike other heading styles the words after the first word except for proper nouns are usually but do not occur numbers are not spelt other members of the publishing staff often write headlines but this will help focus your thoughts and perhaps save those other employees for some time

what is the newspaper byline

byline byline is the authors name in this case  your name it tells who wrote the story

what is a newspaper byline

lead it is also called lead paragraph that has all the who what when where why and how the author needs to find answers to these questions and write to them the opening sentence of the article the lead is usually the first paragraph and is written to provide a preview of the entire story it contains a summary of the story and contains many basic facts the lead will help readers decide if they want to read the rest of the story or if they are satisfied knowing these details

what is the newspaper storyline

storyline once you set the stage with a good lead follow a wellwritten story that includes facts from your research and quotes from people you interviewed have done the article should not have your opinion detail any events in chronological order use active voice  not passive voice  when possible and write in clear short direct sentences

in a news article you usually place the most important information in the opening paragraph and follow up with supporting information enough to ensure that the reader sees the important details first and that you hope to continue until the end is ready from

source keep your sources with information and citations that they do not provide at the bottom of each page or the end of the story as you would for an academic paper

your conclusion can be your final information summary or carefully chosen quote to leave the reader with a strong sense of your information

what are the 5 parts of a newspaper article

who  who was involved

what  what happened

where  where did it happen

why  why it happened

when  when did it happen

how  how it happened

how do i find newspaper articles

now how will you know where to submit the article talk to the editor yourself and write and submit the article as per your need

there are a multitude of different types of articles including news stories features profiles instructional articles and so on while each has specific qualities that are unique to its type all articles share some common characteristics from forming and researching your idea to writing and editing your work writing articles can give you a chance to share compelling and important information with readers

part
1
forming your idea
image titled write articles step 1
1
get familiar with the type of article you want to write as youre figuring out your topic and focus think about the type of article that will best suit the points that you want to convey some article types are better suited to certain topics some of the most common types of articles are
news this type of article presents facts about something that happened recently or that will happen in the near future it usually covers the 5 ws and h who what where when why and how
feature this type of article presents information in a more creative descriptive way than a straight news article it can be an article about a person a phenomenon a place or other subject
editorial this article presents a writers opinions on a topic or debate it is intended to persuade the reader to think a certain way about a topic1
howto this article gives clear instructions and information about how to accomplish some task
profile this article presents information about a person using information that the writer typically gathers through interviews and background research
image titled write articles step 2
2
brainstorm your topic make a list of potential topics you might want to write about immigration or organic food or your local animal shelter to write a coherent yet concise article you need to narrow the topic2 this will give you something more specific to write about which will make for a more forceful article ask yourself these questions
what interests you about this topic
what is a point that people usually overlook
what do you want people to know about this topic
for example if you want to write about organic farming you might say to yourself i think its important to know what organic labeling means on food packages it can be confusing to know what it all means
image titled write articles step 3
3
choose something youre passionate about make sure its something you can write a lot about you should care about the topic you choose to write about your enthusiasm will show in your writing and will be much more engaging for your readers
your goal is to convey enough passion that your readers think the issue in your article is worth caring about
image titled write articles step 4
4
conduct preliminary research if youre not at all familiar with your topic if for instance you need to write on a specific topic for a class assignment then you will need to start conducting some preliminary research
enter some keywords into an online search engine this can lead you to sources that write about your topic these sources can also give you an idea of different approaches to the topic
read as much as you can on the topic visit your local library consult books magazine articles published interviews and online features as well as news sources blogs and databases for information a good place to start looking for data not apparent on the internet is the gale directory of databases which exists in both book format available in libraries or online
image titled write articles step 5
5
find a unique angle when you have decided on your topic and youve narrowed it down to something more specific think about how you can make this article stand out3 if you are writing an article about something that other people are also writing about try to be unique in how you approach the material you should add to the conversation not exist alongside it
for example for the organic food topic you might focus on one grocery shopper who doesnt understand organic food labeling use that opening anecdote to lead into your main argument known as a nut graph which summarizes your unique idea or perspective
image titled write articles step 6
6
hone your argument in most articles the writer makes an argument this is the main thrust of the article then the writer finds evidence to support this argument to make a quality article you need a quality argument after youve settled on your unique angle you can really zero in on the argument that youre trying to make
for example if you are writing about how one person learns how to read organic labels your overall argument might be that the public needs to be aware that many companies misuse organic labeling this leads to dishonest practices in product advertising another topic might be its important to know who owns your local media outlets if corporate media organizations own your local newspaper you may get very little media coverage of your area and not know much about your community
write your argument in one sentence post it near your computer or writing area this will help you stay focused as you start working on your article
part
2
researching your idea
image titled write articles step 7
1
learn about your topic and argument start researching your specific topic and argument go beyond the preliminary research you already conducted learn the fundamental issues at stake the pros and cons what the experts say and so on
the best writers have a documents state of mind they search both for primary original unpublished documents and secondary documents on that subject
primary sources can include a transcript from a legislative hearing lawsuit filing county property indexes with folio numbers discharge certificates from the military and photos other primary sources could include government written records in the national archives or special collections sections of your local or university library insurance policies corporate financial reports or personal background reports
secondary sources comprise published databases books abstracts articles in english and other languages bibliographies dissertations and reference books
you can find information on the internet or in a library you can also conduct interviews watch documentaries or consult other sources
image titled write articles step 8
2
gather supporting evidence start identifying ways that you might support your overall argument you should gather about 35 solid examples that support your overall argument
you can make a longer list of evidence and examples as you gather more evidence you will be able to prioritize which ones are the strongest examples
image titled write articles step 9
3
use reliable sources be wary when researching online draw only from reliable sources like reputable newspapers experts on the topic government websites or university websites scan for information that lists other sources since this will help back up any claims made by your source you can also find sources in print and the same precautions should be taken there
dont assume that one source is completely accurate youll need several unrelated sources to get the full picture
image titled write articles step 10

keep track of your research sources write down where you get your information so you can cite the sources typically the bibliographic information for a source includes the authors name article title publication title year page number and publisher
choose a citation style sooner rather than later so you can compile citation information in the correct format mla apa and chicago are some of the most common citation styles

5
avoid plagiarism when you are looking at other sources be careful about how you compile information sometimes people copy text into a single document to use as notes for their article but in doing so they risk potential plagiarism because the copied text gets mixed up in their own written work be sure to keep careful track of which writing is not yours
dont copy any text directly from another source paraphrase this text instead and include a citation

outlining your idea
image titled write articles step 12
1
decide on the articles length does this article have a word count do you need to fill a certain number of pages consider what type of content youre writing about and how much space this will fill furthermore think about how much needs to be written to cover the topic adequately
image titled write articles step 13
2
consider your audience think about who is going to read your article you need to consider the reading level interests expectations and so on
for example if you are writing an article for a specialized academic audience your tone and approach will be vastly different from if youre writing an article for a popular magazine
image titled write articles step 14
3
outline your article before you begin to formally write write up an outline of your article this outline will break down which information goes where it serves as a guide to help you figure out where you need additional information
its helpful to start with the fiveparagraph essay outline4 this outline devotes one paragraph to an introduction three paragraphs for supporting evidence and one paragraph for a conclusion as you start plugging in information into your outline you may find that this structure doesnt suit your article so well
you might also find that this structure doesnt suit certain types of articles for example if youre doing a profile of a person your article may follow a different format
image titled write articles step 15
4
choose quotes and other evidence to support your points you will likely come across information that succinctly supports what youre saying this might include a statement that someone has made or a sentence within another article that is particularly relevant choose the most important and descriptive part to use in your piece add these quotes to your outline
make sure to fully attribute your quote and use quotation marks around anything that you didnt write yourself for example you might write a spokesperson for the dairy brand milktoast says our milk is labeled organic because our cows are only fed organic grass
dont overdo the quotes be selective about the quotes you do use if you use too many quotes your reader might think youre using them as filler instead of coming up with your material
part

writing your article
image titled write articles step 16
1
write your introduction a compelling introductory paragraph is crucial for hooking your reader within the first few sentences the reader will evaluate whether your article is worth reading in its entirety there are many ways to start an article some of which include
telling an anecdote
using a quote from an interview subject
starting with a statistic
starting with straight facts of the story
image titled write articles step 17
2
follow your outline youve drafted your article in outline form and this will help you focus on writing a solid and coherent article the outline can also help you remember how details connect to each other you will also be reminded of how certain quotes support certain points that youre making
be flexible however sometimes when you write the flow makes sense in a way that is different from your outline be ready to change the direction of your piece if it seems to read better that way
image titled write articles step 18
3
give proper context dont assume your reader knows as much about your topic as you do think about the kinds of background information that your reader needs to understand the topic 5 depending on the type of article you might give a paragraph with background information before proceeding into your supporting evidence or you might weave in this contextual information throughout your article
image titled write articles step 19
4
show with description use eloquent and descriptive language to give the reader a good picture of what youre writing about carefully choose descriptive verbs and precise adjectives
for example you might write about the grocery shopper having trouble with organic food labels charlie concentrated on jars of peanut butter on the shelf the words organic and natural seemed to jump out at him every jar said something different he felt they were shouting at him choose me buy me the words started swimming in front of his eyes he left the aisle without buying anything

5
include transitions link each separate idea with transitions so that your article reads as one cohesive piece start each new paragraph with a transition that links it to the previous paragraph
for example use words or phrases such as however another important point is or it must be remembered that

6
pay attention to style structure and voice you will want to write with a style structure and voice which makes sense for the type of article you are writing evaluate your audience to determine what the best method would be to present your information to them
for example a newspaper article will need to offer information in a narrative chronological format it should be written with accessible and straightforward language an academic article will be written with more formal language a howto article might be written in more informal language
when writing your article use a strong anchoring sentence at the beginning of each paragraph to move your reader forward moreover vary the length of your sentences both short and long if you find all your sentences are about the same word length chances are your reader will be lulled into a standard rhythm and fall asleep sentences which are consistently choppy and short may give your reader the impression you are writing advertising copy instead of a wellthoughtout article

7
write a compelling conclusion wrap up your article with a dynamic conclusion depending on your article this might be a conclusion that empowers the reader for example if youre writing an opinion piece about food labeling you might convey to your readers how they can learn more about labeling
if you started with an anecdote or statistic in your introduction think about reconnecting to this point in your conclusion
conclusions are often strongest when they use a last brief concrete example that leads the reader to new insights conclusions should be forwardthinking  point the reader in a direction that keeps his or her thirst for knowledge going strong

8
think about adding supplemental material you can help your reader understand your topic more clearly by including graphics or other supplemental material
for example you could include photographs charts or infographics to illustrate some of your points
you could also highlight or develop a major point more with a sidebartype box this is an extra bit of writing that delves more deeply into one aspect of the subject for example if youre writing about your citys film festival you might include a sidebar writeup that highlights one of the films these types of writeups are usually short 5075 words depending on the publication outlet
remember these materials are supplemental this means that your article should stand on its own your writing needs to be understandable clear and focused without the help of charts photographs or other graphics
part
5
finalizing your work

1
edit your work take some time to edit and revise your article if time allows wait for a day or two before editing this will give you some distance from your article then you will be able to view your article with fresh eyes
look closely at the central argument or point youre trying to make does everything in your article serve this central argument do you have a unrelated paragraph if so this paragraph should be eliminated or reframed so that it supports the main argument
eliminate any contradictory information in the article or address the contradictions showing how the contradictory information is relevant to readers
rewrite sections or the entire thing as necessary revisions like this are common for all types of articles so dont feel like youve failed or are incompetent

2
comb through for grammatical errors even when an article is wellwritten it will not be taken as seriously if it has grammatical errors or spelling mistakes make sure your writing is forceful by cleaning up your grammar
its helpful to print out a hard copy of your article go through it with a pen or pencil to catch mistakes then go back and correct these mistakes on the computer

3
read your article out loud to yourself listen for tone rhythm sentence length coherence grammatical or content errors and compelling arguments think of your writing as a piece of music an auditory experience and use your ears to evaluate the quality strengths and weaknesses
it is common to be able to identify your mistakes in grammar or writing while reading aloud as well this could cut down on the feedback that you may receive from someone else

4
have someone else read your article try showing the article to a friend teacher or others trusted individual to read it does this person understand the points youre trying to make does he follow your logic
this person may also catch errors and inconsistencies that you have overlooked

5
write a headline give your article a suitable headline the headline is short and to the point using no more than about 10 words or 50 characters if that6 a headline should be actionoriented and should convey why the story is important it should grab readers and draw them into the article7
if you want to convey slightly more information write a subheadline this is a secondary sentence that builds on the headline

by sahil

covid19 has affected all sections of human life while it affected all industry sectors it has a major impact on education classes were switched from offline to online at night but it created confusion among students especially the ones that were about to enter college students even took a gap year hoping for the situation to get better while schools and colleges are opening because vaccination is in full swing across the globe there are still many challenges

understanding covid19 how it spreads and how to protect ourselves are the most important things to be learned first as soon as the school reopens students should know the rules they are going to follow and the benefits of following the covid19 safety rules in the school classroom its very difficult to make the children understand because innocent minds may not get acquainted with the current situation

to avoid the risk of contracting the covid 19 these rules should be followed by every student and school faculty at all times students must carry hand sanitisers at all times students should never sneeze on their hands rather they should cover them with their elbows or may use a tissue or a handkerchief inform students not to touch their eyes nose and mouth frequently as chances are high that the virus gets spread through the touching of the eyes and nose if students and teachers follow these basic rules the spread can be stopped and schools can reopen

article on my vision of india in the future
my vision of india in the future
by aayush

most of us have a psychological barrier to looking at indias future vision and those who perceive the future as coming straight out of the present typically have their perspective narrowed as well i believe that the year 2050 will belong to individuals who strive to recognise diversity as a virtue in and of itself rather than as a tool for combating new mental monocultures or a necessary compromise for social and ethical concord in the future india will be in the centre of the world with variety valued as a goal in itself my vision statement is neither a forecast of what will happen nor a wish list of desirable but unreachable goals

its a statement of what we believe our country can achieve given the level of concern that our current youth has about issues like corruption pollution and mismanagement of natural resources among other things recognize that the elements that affect national development have changed in recent years and will continue to change in the future when imagining india in 2050 this is expected to create more opportunities than ever before

the expanding impact and influence of india in domains such as technology education information and productive skills supports the belief that india will attain and sustain higher economic growth and development in the decades ahead

7 tips for writing a good article quickly
in the age of the internet article writers who can generate good content in a short time period are in increasingly high demand however writing articles or blogging under tight deadlines should not come at the expense of good writing here is a stepbystep guide full of great tips to help you write a good article in record time

1 keep a list of ideas handy you never know when writers block will hit thats why its important to keep a list of ideas for potential news articles or personal stories that could be expanded into essays any time you have an idea jot it down in a notebook or in a word document on your computer that way when its time to start writing youll already have a place to start
2 eliminate distractions a lot of people claim to work better while multitasking rarely is this actually the case especially if the goal is to write an entire article in a short amount of time the best articles require your complete and undivided attention before you begin writing your first sentence turn off the tv and mute social media so you can focus solely on article writing
3 research efficiently research is important for any piece of writing but its also easy to fall into the trap of spending too much time researching and not enough time writing your first draft if youre looking for facts or statistics to support your argument try to be as specific as possible in your search terms if you arent finding the support youre looking for the takeaway may be that you need to adjust your thesis or subject matter
4 keep it simple a readers attention span is generally short so one of the best things that you can do as a writer is to keep your article direct and concise having a maximum word count goal will help you not only help you complete your writeups faster but it will also result in a streamlined article that focuses on major points while eliminating fluff
5 try writing in bullet points writing in bullet points can help you organize your thoughts and complete the article faster also bullet point articles often drive higher traffic since search engine algorithms tend to prioritize articles with bullet points and subheadings writing in bullet points is not only a timesaver it can also increase the likelihood your article reaching your target audience
6 edit after writing one of the most common mistakes that writers make is trying to edit while they write resist this urge trying to edit while in the process of writing can slow you down increasing the likelihood that you wont even make it past the intro good writers know that writing and editing are two distinct and separate processes once youve gotten to the end then you can go back and focus on writing the perfect first line sharpening your first paragraph or tying things together with a clever kicker
7 set a timer a great way to become a quicker and more efficient writer is to practice writing to a timer set a timer for 30 minutes and see how much you can get done youll be surprised how much you can produce during a half hour of focused uninterrupted writing

in the b2 first writing paper you could be asked to write an article about a variety of topics however its often something youve recently learned to do or know a lot about for example the question might be about a concert youve been to recently you favourite hobby or your hometown

the idea is to write in a way that grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested until the very end

differences between articles and essays
in an article you need to constantly be telling the reader what you think
the article is informal the essay is formal and neutral
the essay has a clear organisation whereas the article might not
b2 first fce article structure
title
think of an interesting title which will make people want to read your article
introduction
start your article in an interesting way you could ask the reader a question or make a strong statement
1st body paragraph
the first paragraph should involve the reader in some way
2nd body paragraph
build on the interest you have raised in the first paragraph by telling the next part of the story

b2 first fce article writing guide
title
articles usually have a title the title should be informative give the reader an idea of the subject and attractive make the reader want to read the article

keep it short 25 words and clear

no need for a complete sentence
title a the internet a great invention

title b keep it healthy

introduction
the start of the article should be linked to the title introduce the topic and engage the reader often an article starts with a question that introduces the topic which will be discussed in the article

general statement about the topic
start with a question problem or quotation
introduction a the internet has changed the way we live it started as something that we could access only through a computer but nowadays it is everywhere and i love it

introduction b are you a busy college student do you struggle to keep fit and eat healthily dont worry i am going to tell you exactly what you should do keep on reading you will thank me later

paragraphs 12
each should be clearly defined not too long and clearly linked

describe issues in detail and use one paragraph per issue
use linkers sequencing and sophisticated vocabulary
paragraph a1 one of the cool things about the world wide web is that you can 
paragraph a2 however the greatest thing about the internet is how you can learn tons of things

paragraph 1b first of all you must start moving your body you could go to the gym if 
paragraph b2secondly your diet is just as important i suppose you live on a low budget

conclusion
an ending can state an opinion give the reader something to think about summarise the article or even end with a quotation

conclusion a if you follow all these tips im sure you will keep fit easily and if you already tried that let me know how you feel now

conclusion b in conclusion the internet has a lot of great things for me the best are finding information and learning online what about you what are your favourite things about it

lets summarize  how to write an article
give your article a title
try and engage the readers attention and interest ask questions at the beginning
there should be a link between the opening sentence and the title
personalise the article using true stories or anecdotes
if you decide to take a lighthearted approach or a more serious one maintain the same style throughout the article
check your work for accuracy punctuation and spelling
article could be light or serious but should be consistent depending on who the target reader is may use some rhetorical questions eg can you imagine a school where every student enjoys themselves

a local magazine has asked readers to write an article about their favourite things about the internet write the article talking about the things you do with the internet and recommend a website to other readers

students fce article answer
the internet a great invention

the internet has changed the way we live it started as something that we could access only through a computer but nowadays it is everywhere and i love it

one of the cool things about the world wide web is that you can look up anything you want and nd out the answer straight away isnt that fantastic for example imagine you are arguing with your friends about how to do something easy solution go online and find the answer

however the greatest thing about the internet is how you can learn tons of things very cheaply or even for free in fact my favourite website is wwwudemycomwhere people register to teach and learn about different things music website design making apps history etc so i totally recommend it to everyone

in conclusion the internet has a lot of great things for me the best are finding information and learning online what about you what are your favourite things about it

write a howto article in 6 easy steps
if youve ever jotted down a recipe or shared doityourself instructions with a friend you already understand the basic structure of howto writing christina katz offers a sixstep process for writing a good explainer
christinakatzsep 6 2011
do you know how to prepare an exquisite turkey dinner on a shoestring execute a perfect rugby tackle pay rockbottom rates for accommodations in exotic destinations all over the world

if youve ever jotted down a recipe or shared doityourself instructions with a friend you already understand the basic structure of howto writing howtos inform the reader and can often be submitted to an editor with a simple cover letter

10 rules for writing opinion pieces

a howto is written as a sequencefirst you do this and then you do this the essential question the writer asks herself when writing a howto is what happens next if you are about to embark on a howto start at what you consider the beginning and just keep answering that question over and over again before you know it you will have sketched out a draft of a howto article

step 1 select your topic
choose a topic that interests you enough to focus on it for at least a week or two if your topic is broad narrow it instead of writing about how to decorate your home try covering how to decorate your home in country style on a shoestring budget thats more specific and as such easier to tackle

then write a rough rough draft including everything you can think of stay loose avoid getting analytical and enjoy the process of sharing what you know when youre done youll have the bare bones of an article that only you could write then put it aside for a while

step 2 address your audiences needs
now come back to your piece switch gears and imagine youre the reader of this article pick three words to describe the audience you want to address eg professionals single men as this reader what questions would you like answered you might not know the answers yet but list the questions anyway youll find answers in the next step

step 3 research
research will ground your article in fact good details to include with your howto are

statistics
quotes by wellknown people
definitions
anecdotes short illustrative stories about yourself or someone else
quotes and examples from people like the reader or from popular books on the subject
references to other media film television radio
references to local venues or events if for a regionallocal publication
helpful tools resources or products if many consider creating a sidebar
collect everything you have gathered and put it in a folder an electronic document a notebook or whatever you like dont forget to keep track of sources in case you are later asked by an editor to verify them you may want to sift through your research at a separate sitting from gathering it or just go ahead and sprinkle your research in right when you find it its a lot like cookingplay around until you feel you have it just right

research tips for writing nonfiction

step 4 tighten your draft
keeping your audience in mind write a tighter draft incorporating the new supporting information youve collected sometimes what youve learned in steps 2 and 3 may compel you to start over with a completely fresh draft or you may just want to revise what you have as you proceed retaining a nice conversational tone by directly addressing your audience

this time when you read your draft ask yourself is it working is it too general too lightweight uninteresting unclear or choppy if so comb some of your favorite publications for howto articles what techniques are those writers using that you might employ

step 5 make it specific
doublecheck to see that youve included every pertinent step in the process howto articles have to be thorough you want your reader to walk away knowing exactly how to make that thanksgiving dinner on a shoestring budget execute that rugby tackle or locate great accommodations

if your narrative goes on and on or off in too many directions break it down into key points indicated with subheads as in this article synthesizing complicated information and breaking it down into steps is especially crucial for online writing and is also a trend in print

step 6 read revise repeat
read the draft of your howto article out loud to a supportive friend then ask her a series of questions does she now understand the process are there any steps missing is there anything else she would like to know about the subject could she do the task herself with your friends suggestions in mind use your best judgment in deciding what changes if any need to be made

heres a quick list to help you catch errors or omissions

did you adequately describe the ingredientssupplies needed in order for the reader to complete the task
did you include all the important steps
is the order logical
did you use words that indicate sequence first next then
did you warn readers of possible pitfalls
rewrite read aloud rewrite read aloud rewrite find a proofreader and only when youre satisfied youve written an effective howto article submit your piece to an appropriate publication with a short cover letter

how to write and structure a journal article
sharing your research data can be hugely beneficial to your career as well as to the scholarly community and wider society but before you do so there are some important ethical considerations to remember

what are the rules and guidance you should follow when you begin to think about how to write and structure a journal article ruth first prize winner steven rogers phd said the first thing is to be passionate about what you write

  getting motivated to write is often very difficult therefore writing something you have very little passion for does not make it any easier
steven nabieu rogers ruth first prize winner

lets go through some of the best advice that will help you pinpoint the features of a journal article and how to structure it into a compelling research paper

planning for your article
when planning to write your article make sure it has a central message that you want to get across this could be a novel aspect of methodology that you have in your phd study a new theory or an interesting modification you have made to theory or a novel set of findings

2018 narst award winner marissa rollnick advised that you should decide what this central focus is then create a paper outline bearing in mind the need to

isolate a manageable size

create a coherent storyargument

make the argument selfstanding

target the journal readership

change the writing conventions from that used in your thesis

get familiar with the journal you want to submit to
it is a good idea to choose your target journal before you start to write your paper then you can tailor your writing to the journals requirements and readership to increase your chances of acceptance

when selecting your journal think about audience purposes what to write about and why decide the kind of article to write is it a report position paper critique or review what makes your argument or research interesting how might the paper add value to the field

if you need more guidance on how to choose a journal here is our guide to narrow your focus

once youve chosen your target journal take the time to read a selection of articles already published  particularly focus on those that are relevant to your own research

this can help you get an understanding of what the editors may be looking for then you can guide your writing efforts

the think check submit initiative provides tools to help you evaluate whether the journal youre planning to send your work to is trustworthy

the journals aims and scope is also an important resource to refer back to as you write your paper  use it to make sure your article aligns with what the journal is trying to accomplish

keep your message focused
the next thing you need to consider when writing your article is your target audience are you writing for a more general audience or is your audience experts in the same field as you the journal you have chosen will give you more information on the type of audience that will read your work

when you know your audience focus on your main message to keep the attention of your readers a lack of focus is a common problem and can get in the way of effective communication

stick to the point the strongest journal articles usually have one point to make they make that point powerfully back it up with evidence and position it within the field

how to format and structure a journal article
the format and structure of a journal article is just as important as the content itself it helps to clearly guide the reader through

how do i format a journal article
individual journals will have their own specific formatting requirements which you can find in the instructions for authors

you can save time on formatting by downloading a template from our library of templates to apply to your article text these templates are accepted by many of our journals also a large number of our journals now offer formatfree submission which allows you to submit your paper without formatting your manuscript to meet that journals specific requirements

general structure for writing an academic journal article
title
the title of your article is one of the first indicators readers will get of your research and concepts it should be concise accurate and informative you should include your most relevant keywords in your title but avoid including abbreviations and formulae

keywords
keywords are an essential part of producing a journal article when writing a journal article you must select keywords that you would like your article to rank for

keywords help potential readers to discover your article when conducting research using search engines

abstract
the purpose of your abstract is to express the key points of your research clearly and concisely an abstract must always be well considered as it is the primary element of your work that readers will come across

an abstract should be a short paragraph around 300 words that summarizes the findings of your journal article ordinarily an abstract will be comprised of

what your research is about

what methods have been used

what your main findings are

acknowledgements
acknowledgements can appear to be a small aspect of your journal article however it is still important this is where you acknowledge the individuals who do not qualify for coauthorship but contributed to your article intellectually financially or in some other manner

when you acknowledge someone in your academic texts it gives you more integrity as a writer as it shows that you are not claiming other academics ideas as your own intellectual property it can also aid your readers in their own research journeys

introduction
an introduction is a pivotal part of the article writing process an introduction not only introduces your topic and your stance on the topic but it also situatescontextualizes your argument in the broader academic field

main body
the main body is where your main arguments and your evidence are located each paragraph will encapsulate a different notion and there will be clear linking between each paragraph

conclusion
your conclusion should be an interpretation of your results where you summarize all of the concepts that you introduced in the main body of the text in order of most to least important no new concepts are to be introduced in this section

references and citations
references and citations should be well balanced current and relevant although every field is different you should aim to cite references that are not more than 10 years old if possible the studies you cite should be strongly related to your research question

clarity is key
make your writing accessible by using clear language writing that is easy to read is easier to understand too

you may want to write for a global audience  to have your research reach the widest readership make sure you write in a way that will be understood by any reader regardless of their field or whether english is their first language

write your journal article with confidence to give your reader certainty in your research make sure that youve described your methodology and approach whilst it may seem obvious to you it may not to your reader and dont forget to explain acronyms when they first appear

engage your audience go back to thinking about your audience are they experts in your field who will easily follow technical language or are they a lay audience who need the ideas presented in a simpler way

be aware of other literature in your field and reference it
make sure to tell your reader how your article relates to key work thats already published this doesnt mean you have to review every piece of previous relevant literature but show how you are building on previous work to avoid accidental plagiarism

when you reference something fully understand its relevance to your research so you can make it clear for your reader keep in mind that recent references highlight awareness of all the current developments in the literature that you are building on this doesnt mean you cant include older references just make sure it is clear why youve chosen to

how old can my references be

your literature review should take into consideration the current state of the literature

there is no specific timeline to consider but note that your subject area may be a factor your colleagues may also be able to guide your decision

researchers view
it is important to demonstrate that you have a good grasp of the dominant debates and theories in your field it is your ability to deploy both theoretical rigor and empirical evidence in your contribution that makes your article stand out it is not good enough to challenge dominant theories without offering alternative theoretical approaches or without deploying empirical evidence to validate your claims do not speculate provide evidence
grasian mkodzongi ruth first prize winner

top tips to get you started
communicate your unique point of view to stand out you may be building on a concept already in existence but you still need to have something new to say make sure you say it convincingly and fully understand and reference what has gone before

editors view
its important that authors try to connect their ideas their issue and their topic to something that is existing it may be to challenge that or it may be to confirm it it may be to reexamine it or to indicate why whichever way they want to engage with it its crucial that people take that time and thought to do that
professor len barton founding editor of disability and society

2 include your name
adding a name or author information to your article can help humanize your brand this can allow you to build better relationships with readers and develop a community around your content if you have a content team have them take turns publishing posts with their own bylines and a bio at the end of the article this might even encourage some of your readers to comment on your articles and start a conversation with the writer by asking them questions or voicing concerns about the material this also gives your team the opportunity to showcase their expertise in a particular topic

3 write the introduction
your introduction tells your audience what the article is about and explains to them why they might find the information interesting often an articles introduction can mean the difference between someone continuing to read or immediately clicking away use strategies to catch your audiences attention like captivating narratives that outline a problem your target audience faces with the promise of demonstrating how to solve it

here are additional tips to improve your articles introduction

keep introductions short and concise write three to four sentences for your introduction to inform the audience about what they can expect to read use writing techniques to generate suspense for the reader and enhance their curiosity about the articles topic
shorten the length of sentences write shorter sentences so the reader can easily understand what youre writing write in the present active tense and remove filler words like that just even and seem to strengthen the quality of your content
write the body first write the rest of your content before writing your intro paragraph to give you options on how to present your story you may try to add the introduction with placeholder text and complete it once you write the rest of the article
deliver on promises only introduce topics your article will explain further this approach builds trust with a reader because they want to read about what attracted them to your article
4 insert your body
the body of your article should include different headings that relate to the topic for example lets say youre writing an article on how to change a tire your headings might include why is it important to know how to change a tire tips for changing a tire on a highway and steps for changing your tire under each of these headings you can write short paragraphs that deliver unique information to the reader based on the subject of the heading

though the number of headings in an article may vary its beneficial to have at least two this can help break up the information and improve the readability of your piece if youre writing listicles or howto articles you can also create subheadings for each of the steps or list items improving readability can ensure that your potential customers read your content for a longer period of time which can reduce its bounce rate and increase its conversion rate

5 write a conclusion
the conclusion restates the main point of your article it gives the reader a clear picture of the lesson they should learn after reading the articles content and how the main points connect with the purpose of the article conclusions should include a calltoaction which gives the reader an action to perform once they finish reading your article explain the value of your calltoaction to give the reader an incentive to act on it once you present it to them

these calls to action can include phrases like

how to write an article for your business
here are some steps to help you write a quality article for your businesss marketing efforts

1 define your topics
pick a topic that can entice your target audience to read about your company or your clients company write a list of engaging topics and evaluate how theyre relevant to your target audience if you need to expand your list conduct keyword research to find the highestranking articles on search engines you might need to narrow down your list of topics based on their relevance and the difficulty of the keyword

once you have your keywords and topics create a content schedule this can help you develop deadlines for each article you write and ensure youre posting consistently when you post content consistently it can help increase your audiences loyalty and help them know when new content might be available

2 perform research
once you have the topics ready to go its imperative that you perform research this research can help you deliver quality and accurate information to your readers it can also help you understand the most popular headings other businesses use for their topics for instance lets say youre writing an article on how to write a book when you search that keyword into google take a look at the topranking articles do any of them have similar headings what kind of information do they cover beside the main topic use this information and bring it to your own audience

if you need to perform additional research on content look at different types of evidence to support the main points of your article some data you may find for your article includes

statistics
quotes relevant to your topic
definitions of industryspecific words if applicable
current events on industry topics
facts from national and local news outlets
company data separate from whats available on serps
2 write a draft without editing it
write a rough draft to structure the ideas youre communicating to your target audience this can give you more freedom to write your ideas and thoughts about the direction of your article the ideas and thoughts you write lay the foundation for your article and present the work you need to complete during the editing process keep your research in one folder or document so you can note the data you found and reference it in your content

relevant 9 simple ways to improve your writing

3 read your draft out loud
once youre finished with your rough draft read your article out loud from start to finish refer back to your research to identify if your rough draft matches the tone and messaging of your company or what your client requested for example you might note that you need to elaborate on the yearround benefit of travel if youre working on an article for a client in the tourism industry

find any errors and fix them and pay attention to sentence flow and structure the notes you make when reading out loud help you humanize your content and keep readers engaged until the end of your article if your target audience stays on the page long enough to read the article it increases their chances of performing the calltoaction for example if a reader clicks on a link in your articles calltoaction it may influence them to buy more products and services or give feedback on their experience with your company

ask an editor or friend to read over your article to make additional edits they might provide insight on what you need to add to improve your articles quality such as adding information to give readers more clarity

4 make final edits
read your article out loud one more time after you make all edits to ensure that youre confident of its quality if you have a style guide read it over again to make sure your content aligns with their specifications then submit

free practice tests for learners of english

five things you need to know about writing articles
in cambridge first or cambridge advanced you might be asked to write an article but do you know what makes an article different from other types of writing

1 the reader is identified
an article is like a direct conversation with the reader the exam question might tell you who your readers are for example the students at a school or the people living in a town or people who are interested in sports everything you write must speak to that reader and engage their interest right from the first sentence

2 it has to get attention
if youre anywhere on the internet these days youll be bombarded with articles with headlines that pull the reader in its called click baiting and all the writer is trying to do is make you open the page to read their article you need to think like a journalist when youre writing your article
look at the heading and the first line of this article how did i get your attention*

3 it has to be interesting
for an article to work it has to be engaging enough to read all the way through remember how bored the examiner must be after reading fifty exam papers make it easier for them to get a good impression about your writing by entertaining them add humour real life or made up examples or make up quotes

4 it has to be easy to read
use subheadings to break up the text and make clear paragraphs write in a semiinformal conversational style and make sure there is organisation to your ideas the planning stage is vital for this spend 510 minutes brainstorming ideas and choose the best three or four think what your subheadings might be and then write a short introduction that lets the reader know what to expect
keep in mind that you want the reader to keep reading so dont tell them exactly what they will read this is not an essay in an essay you usually restate the question explain how you will answer it and maybe say why its important in an article that will kill the readers interest
look back at this paragraph what sentence style have i used that makes it semiinformal and speak directly to the reader**

5 write a good ending
in an essay you sum up the points that have gone before and draw a conclusion from that but in an article its better to give the reader something to think about perhaps by asking them another question or giving them a call to action often the best endings link back to the starting point in some way
here are two endings i could use for this article

look at your internet browsing history from the last day which articles got your attention can you see how they did it
so now you know how to write an article why dont you write one giving advice on something you know about
common mistakes students make in articles

the language is too formal and more suited to essays avoid words like to sum up some people say nevertheless on one hand etc
they dont use quotes or examples
they either use not enough or too many questions the questions called rhetorical questions because they dont require an answer shouldnt be more than one per paragraph good examples are
have you ever 
what do you think about 
are you one of those people who thinks that 
what would life be like if 
will the future bring us  
* a title which makes the subject immediately clear for some reason people like reading lists and a direct rhetorical question in the first paragraph to make readers want to find out the answer
** ive used the imperative to give instructions eg thinkkeep in mindwritespend

blog post cover picture


the internet is flooded with lowquality articles breaking through the noise to reach your target audience can be a formidable challenge

thats why we want to discuss how to write an article that brings in thousands of readers

are you serious about building a loyal following lets get started

step 1 understand your target audience
want to write articles that resonate with people

then you need to first make sure that you understand your target audience

why is understanding your readers so essential
understanding your target audience allows you to

establish an emotional connection with your readers by empathizing with them
provide effective solutions to the problems that they are struggling with
choose an appropriate tone
you need to get all these three elements right because they determine the articles quality

what do you need to know about your readers
here are some of the questions that you should ask about your target audience

who are your readers
what do your readers value
what do your readers want to achieve
what are your readers struggling with
how do your readers perceive themselves
you also want to pay attention to the phrases metaphors jargon etc your readers use so that you could speak to your target audience in their own language

what can you do to understand your readers better
here are three ways to understand your readers better

1 go where your readers hang out online and observe the conversations happening there this could mean following popular hashtags subscribing to subreddits registering on online forums joining paid communities etc

you can even take this to the next level with text analysis its a machine learning technique that enables you to sift through vast quantities of data and extract actionable insights from it

for example you could use text analytics software to analyze all tweets that feature a particular hashtag which might not be humanly possible to do manually

2 consume the content that your readers consume this could mean reading the same blogs listening to the same podcasts subscribing to the same youtube channels etc

3 talk to your readers oneonone ask potential readers to have a 15minute skype call with you so that you could pick their brains everyone wants to be heard so getting people to agree to this might be easier than you think

wont all this take too much time
proper customer research is extremely timeconsuming

and make no mistake if you want to make a living as a writer learning everything you can about your readers is customer research

thats why we recommend

picking a niche
sticking to that niche
that way the benefits of customer research will compound over time which will simplify your writing process enable you to consistently create quality content and give you an advantage over other writers

step 2 pick a target keyword for your article
okay so now that you have conducted extensive customer research you should have a pretty good idea of what topics your readers are most interested in

but you shouldnt start writing just yet

what is seo content
blog content can be divided into two broad categories

seo content that is designed to rank on the first page of googles search results for a specific keyword and generate organic search traffic
content that is designed to provide value to the existing readers without the intention of generating organic search traffic
joshua hardwick the head of content at ahrefs gives this example of the latter

you might think that all content is seo content but thats not the case for example we have a lot of studies on our blog and most of them get little or no organic traffic does this mean those posts failednot at all we published these posts to bring new insights to the seo communitynot to rank in google

ahrefscasestudypng

ahrefs case studies get little organic search traffic but provide a ton of value to the existing readers source ahrefs

before you begin writing an article you need to decide whether you want it to be seo content or something that provides unique value to existing readers

why you need to focus on seo content
when you are just starting out as a blogger your first priority should be to grow your organic search traffic through seo content focusing on your existing readers doesnt make much sense when the only person reading your blog is your grandma

so shelve all those creative essay ideas for now you need to build your readership first

how to choose a target keyword
seo writing should always start with keyword research

there are plenty of free keyword research tools out there but we recommend ahrefs

ahrefssoftwarejpg

ahrefs is arguably the most powerful seo tool out there source ahrefs

their plans start at $99month with a 7day trial that only costs $7

a week is more than enough time to create a content plan for the next three months  all you need is 12 promising keywords if you intend to publish one article per week

you can learn the basics of keyword research in just 10 minutes by watching this video

of course if you can afford it you might want to continue using ahrefs after the 7day trial because its functionality goes way beyond keyword research

step #3 figure out how to make your article better than the competition
once you have your target keyword its time to do competitive research

read the articles that are currently ranking on the first page of google for that keyword
figure out how you can make your article better than all of them
think about it this way

why would google give you a spot on the first page if your content isnt any better than the stuff thats already ranking

here are some ideas on how to write articles that are better than anything else that is out there

make your article more comprehensive provide stepbystep instructions answer common objections add an faq section etc

keep in mind that the average word count of the top 10 search results is evenly distributed which suggests that merely increasing the word count of your article is unlikely to help with the ranking

so dont pad your article with fluff just to increase the articles length

wordamountjpg

increasing your articles length wont necessarily help it rank higher on google source backlinko

provide reallife examples search for relevant case studies then summarize them in your article its best if the person in the case study belongs to your target audience

back up your claims with supporting evidence search for relevant data cite it in your article and link back to primary sources aka the original research make sure that the data you are using is no more than three years old

add expert quotes search for expert quotes on the topic add them to your article link to primary sources eg if you are citing a quote from a book link to the book quotes from people that your target audience is familiar with work the best

share actionable tips avoid giving vague advice such as just be yourself eat less exercise more follow your passion etc focus on actionable advice such as stepbystep instructions wordforword scripts 30day plans etc this is especially important if you are writing a how to article for example in his article guest blogging in 2021 how i wrote 80+ guest posts in 1 year adam enfroy shares the exact email template that he used to land guest posts

share personal experiences do you have relevant experience consider sharing it in your article what did you do and what were the results be as specific as you can your target audience wants to know all the details

find a unique angle obviously you dont want to be contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian but challenging the conventional wisdom when it makes sense can help you make your article more memorable

step 4 create an outline for your article
when you have solid writing skills the actual writing is the easy part

whats hard is figuring out the best way to present your central idea major points and supporting evidence in a way that makes sense

so prepare a detailed outline before you begin writing

heres what it should cover

subheadlines
a list of key points for each section
all the examples statistics and quotes that you intend to use
note that the higher the word count the more important it is to have an outline you can wing a 500word article but you cant wing a 5000word one

however we recommend preparing outlines even for short pieces to establish the habit of thinking things through before writing articles

step 5 write the first draft of your article
now that you have an outline ready its time to start writing your article

we recommend using the pomodoro technique

set a timer for 25 minutes write for the whole 25 minutes no distractions allowed
set a timer for 5 minutes take a break its best to use this time to stretch do some calisthenics get a glass of water etc get away from your computer
this 30minute time block that consists of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest is called a pomodoro

you can use this video to complete a 4hour writing session of eight pomodoros

also if you find yourself suffering from writers block you might want to remind yourself that your goal is to simply get the rough draft done

keep in mind that even if that rough draft is terrible you can always whip it into shape in the editing process

step 6 optimize your article
now its time to optimize your article so that it would have the best shot at ranking on the first page of google

the most popular tool for this is clearscope

it gives you

a word count target
a reading level target
a list of keywords that you should use + the optimal frequency for each keyword
all that is based on the competing articles that are already ranking on the first page of google

its a great tool but its also pricy with plans starting at $170month for up to 20 pieces of content

a more affordable alternative is surferits pricing starts at just $49month

this app provides more detailed suggestions than clearscope but its less polished and its guidelines seem to be less accurate

clearscopesoftwarejpg

clearscope can help you write articles that rank on the first page of google source clearscope

keep in mind that no matter what software you decide to use to optimize your article you still need to exercise common sense your target audience is humans not search enginesso dont turn your article into a keyword salad

step 7 edit your article
and now its time for editing

format the text
when you are writing content for your blog you need to account for how people read articles onlinethey tend to skim through the text instead of reading it in its entirety

thats why its so important to format your article properly

use h2 text for subheadlines
use h3 text for subsubheadlines
break up long sentences use simple sentence structure
break up long paragraphs aim for 23 lines per paragraph
use bullet points and numbered lists whenever you can
the purpose of all this is to make your article as skimmable as possible no one wants to read walls of text

proofread the article yourself
you want to proofread your article manually at least once before you run it through proofreading software

when you are proofreading your own writing its best to read aloud  its much easier to catch errors that way

run the article through grammarly
grammarly is the most popular proofreading app out there we also listed 8 alternatives

grammarlysoftwarejpg

grammarly is the most popular proofreading app out there source grammarly

you can copypaste your text into the apps editor and get suggestions on spelling grammar and sentence structure these features are all available on the free plan

theres also a chrome extension that enables you to use grammarly inside google docs its super helpful because it allows you to catch errors in realtime

however the company has received a ton of criticism over their privacy practices so you might want to read their privacy policy to learn more about how they log user data

step 8 add images to your article
you should also use images to break up the text

a good rule of thumb when writing content is to add at least one image per 500 words

ideally you want to use images that are directly relevant to the content of your article such as screenshots visualizations of data etc

unsplashjpg

unsplash offers beautiful free stock photos source unsplash

try to avoid using generic stock photos in your article because they tend to look tacky and out of place in that context

its okay to use a stock photo for your featured image though

you can source free photos for blogs from sites like unsplash and pexels

step 9 create a powerful headline for your article
your article title aka headline is the most important part of your article because its your one chance to grab peoples attention

but theres no need to waste time reinventing the wheel you can simply use proven headline formulas

jon morrow a popular blogger and writing coach has a free guide called headline hacks in which he shares a bunch of formulas that you can swipe

for example if you need a headline for a how to article you can use one of these templates

howtoheadlineformulasjpg

dont waste time reinventing the wheel use proven headline formulas source headline hacks

step 10 promote your article
you cant just write articles publish them and then sit back and wait

you need to go out there and actively promote each and every article

share the article link on your own social media this could mean posting it on twitter facebook instagram etc
send the article to influential people in your niche you need to establish a connection first if you want this to work though dont just spam complete strangers asking them to share your stuff
build backlinks to that article a backlink is a link from another website to your website simply creating seo content is not enough you also need to build backlinks to it if you want it to rank on google
you can also use paid advertising to promote your articles

for example when chris von wilpert was promoting an article called marketing ideas from intercoms multimillion dollar saas growth strategy one of the things he did was run ads to it he spent $68871 on it

the article ended up attracting 28292 visitors in just over 30 days making it the most popular article ever on noah kagans ok dork blog

of course this is an advanced marketing tactic so you need to be careful if you have never run a paid advertising campaign before its surprisingly easy to burn money on ads when you dont know what youre doing

Colored pencils
Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perception based on the electromagnetic spectrum. Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is related to an object's light absorption, reflection, emission spectra and interference. For most humans, color are perceived in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types or have eyes sensitive to different wavelength, such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and thus have a different color sensitivity range. Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain.

Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation) and luminance. Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light) or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). If the colors are mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength light. For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors and television. The most well-known color models are RGB, CMYK, YUV, HSL and HSV.

Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas. In visual arts, color theory is used to govern the use of colors in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. The theory of color includes the color complements; color balance; and classification of primary colors (traditionally red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (traditionally orange, green, purple) and tertiary colors. The study of colors in general is called color science.

The visible spectrum perceived from 390 to 710 nm wavelength
Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), it is known as "visible light".

Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class, the members are called metamers of the color in question. This effect can be visualized by comparing the light sources' spectral power distributions and the resulting colors.

Spectral colors
Main article: Spectral color
The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum—named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671—include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for spectral colors in the visible range. Spectral colors have 100% purity, and are fully saturated. A complex mixture of spectral colors can be used to describe any color, which is the definition of a light power spectrum.

The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list; the spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency.[1] Despite the ubiquitous ROYGBIV mnemonic used to remember the spectral colors in English, the inclusion or exclusion of colors in this table is contentious, with disagreement often focused on indigo and cyan.[2] Even if the subset of color terms is agreed, their wavelength ranges and borders between them may not be.

The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably according to the Bezold–Brücke shift; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive green.

Color of objects
The physical color of an object depends on how it absorbs and scatters light. Most objects scatter light to some degree and do not reflect or transmit light specularly like glasses or mirrors. A transparent object allows almost all light to transmit or pass through, thus transparent objects are perceived as colorless. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead absorbing or reflecting the light it receives. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but translucent objects are seen colored because they scatter or absorb certain wavelengths of light via internal scatterance. The absorbed light is often dissipated as heat.[3]

Color vision

Development of theories of color vision
Main article: Color theory

The upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the colors as different color categories; see checker shadow illusion.
Although Aristotle and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and color vision, it was not until Newton that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, Goethe published his comprehensive Theory of Colors in which he provided a rational description of color experience, which 'tells us how it originates, not what it is'. (Schopenhauer)

In 1801 Thomas Young proposed his trichromatic theory, based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. As Helmholtz puts it, "the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it."[4]

At the same time as Helmholtz, Ewald Hering developed the opponent process theory of color, noting that color blindness and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus corresponds to the opponent theory.[5]

In 1931, an international group of experts known as the Commission internationale de l'éclairage (CIE) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.

Color in the eye
Main article: Color vision § Cone cells in the human eye

Normalized typical human cone cell responses (S, M, and L types) to monochromatic spectral stimuli
The ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths. Humans are trichromatic—the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or cones. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 nm; cones of this type are sometimes called short-wavelength cones or S cones (or misleadingly, blue cones). The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: middle-wavelength cones, M cones, or green cones are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540 nm, while the long-wavelength cones, L cones, or red cones, are most sensitive to light that is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 nm.

Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the principle of univariance, which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called tristimulus values.[6]

The response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate only the mid-wavelength (so-called "green") cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human color space. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.[7]

The other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the rod, has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all.[8] On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a colorless response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the "red" range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the Kruithof curve, which describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as a function of temperature and intensity.

Color in the brain
Main article: Color vision § Color in the primate brain

The visual dorsal stream (green) and ventral stream (purple) are shown. The ventral stream is responsible for color perception.
While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three opponent processes, or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red–green channel, a blue–yellow channel, and a black–white "luminance" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a "reddish green" or "yellowish blue", and it predicts the color wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.

The exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our perception of the world—a type of qualia—is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.[citation needed]

Nonstandard color perception
Color vision deficiency
Main article: Color blindness
A color vision deficiency causes an individual to perceive a smaller gamut of colors than the standard observer with normal color vision. The effect can be mild, having lower "color resolution" (i.e. anomalous trichromacy), moderate, lacking an entire dimension or channel of color (e.g. dichromacy), or complete, lacking all color perception (i.e. monochromacy). Most forms of color blindness derive from one or more of the three classes of cone cells either being missing, having a shifted spectral sensitivity or having lower responsiveness to incoming light. In addition, cerebral achromatopsia is caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.

Some colors that appear distinct to an individual with normal color vision will appear metameric to the color blind. The most common form of color blindness is congenital red–green color blindness, affecting ~8% of males. Individuals with the strongest form of this condition (dichromacy) will experience blue and purple, green and yellow, teal and gray as colors of confusion, i.e. metamers.[9]

Tetrachromacy
Main article: Tetrachromacy
Outside of humans, which are mostly trichromatic (having three types of cones), most mammals are dichromatic, possessing only two cones. However, outside of mammals, most vertebrate are tetrachromatic, having four types of cones, and includes most, birds, reptiles, amphibians and bony fish. An extra dimension of color vision means these vertebrates can see two distinct colors that a normal human would view as metamers. Some invertebrates, such as the mantis shrimp, have an even higher number of cones (12) that could lead to a richer color gamut than even imaginable by humans.

The existence of human tetrachromats is a contentious notion. As many as half of all human females have 4 distinct cone classes, which could enable tetrachromacy.[10] However, a distinction must be made between retinal (or weak) tetrachromats, which express four cone classes in the retina, and functional (or strong) tetrachromats, which are able to make the enhanced color discriminations expected of tetrachromats. In fact, there is only one peer-reviewed report of a functional tetrachromat.[11] It is estimated that while the average person is able to see one million colors, someone with functional tetrachromacy could see a hundred million colors.[12]

Synesthesia
Main article: Synesthesia
In certain forms of synesthesia, perceiving letters and numbers (grapheme–color synesthesia) or hearing sounds (chromesthesia) will evoke a perception of color. Behavioral and functional neuroimaging experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route. Synesthesia can occur genetically, with 4% of the population having variants associated with the condition. Synesthesia has also been known to occur with brain damage, drugs, and sensory deprivation.[13]

The philosopher Pythagoras experienced synesthesia and provided one of the first written accounts of the condition in approximately 550 BCE. He created mathematical equations for musical notes that could form part of a scale, such as an octave.[14]

Afterimages
Main article: Afterimage
After exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, photoreceptors of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of afterimages, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a complementary color. Afterimage effects have also been used by artists, including Vincent van Gogh.

Color constancy
Main article: Color constancy
When an artist uses a limited color palette, the human eye tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.[15]

The trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by Edwin H. Land in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of color constancy.

Both phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. CIECAM02, iCAM).[16] There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.

Reproduction
Main article: Color reproduction

The CIE 1931 color space xy chromaticity diagram with the visual locus plotted using the CIE (2006) physiologically relevant LMS fundamental color matching functions transformed into the CIE 1931 xy color space and converted into Adobe RGB. The triangle shows the gamut of Adobe RGB. The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in Kelvins. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. The colors in this file are being specified using Adobe RGB. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately rendered since they are outside the gamut of Adobe RGB, therefore they have been interpreted. The colors depicted depend on the gamut and color accuracy of your display.
Color reproduction is the science of creating colors for the human eye that faithfully represent the desired color. It focuses on how to construct a spectrum of wavelengths that will best evoke a certain color in an observer. Most colors are not spectral colors, meaning they are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. However, these non-spectral colors are often described by their dominant wavelength, which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the non-spectral color. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to hue.

There are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to desaturation or because they are purples (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as pink, tan, and magenta.

Two different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the human eye will be perceived as the same color. They are metamers of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although the color rendering index of each light source may affect the color of objects illuminated by these metameric light sources.

Similarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called primaries. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or color spaces for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.

No mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530 nm) and blue light (460 nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor w

English is a west germanic language in the indoeuropean language family with its earliest forms spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval england 3 4 5 it is named after the angles one of the ancient germanic peoples that migrated to the island of great britain existing on a dialect continuum with scots and then most closely related to the low saxon and frisian languages modern english is genealogically germanic although its grammar and core vocabulary are mostly west germanic it has borrowed many words from french about 28% of english words and latin also about 28% 6 as well as some grammar and core vocabulary from old norse a north germanic language 7 8 9 speakers of english are called anglophones

the earliest forms of english collectively known as old english or anglosaxon evolved from a group of north sea germanic dialects brought to great britain by anglosaxon settlers in the 5th century these dialects generally resisted influence from the thenlocal common brittonic and british latin languages however old english dialects were later influenced by old norsespeaking viking settlers and invaders starting in the 8th and 9th centuries at the time old norse even retained considerable mutual intelligibility with certain dialects of old english especially more northern dialects middle english began in the late 11th century after the norman conquest of england when considerable old french especially old norman french and latinderived vocabulary was incorporated into english over some three hundred years 10 11 early modern english began in the late 15th century with the start of the great vowel shift and the renaissance trend of borrowing further latin and greek words and roots into english concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to london this era notably culminated in the king james bible and the works of william shakespeare 12 13 the printing press greatly standardised english spelling citation needed which has remained largely unchanged since then despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in different english dialects

modern english grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical indoeuropean dependentmarking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subjectverbobject word order 14 modern english relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses aspects and moods as well as passive constructions interrogatives and some negation

modern english has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the british empire and the united states of america through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries english has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science navigation and law 3 english is the most spoken language in the world 15 and the third most spoken native language in the world after standard chinese and spanish 16 it is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states there are more people who have learned english as a second language than there are native speakers as of 2005 it was estimated that there were over two billion speakers of english 17 english is the majority native language in the united kingdom the united states canada australia new zealand and the republic of ireland see anglosphere and is widely spoken in some areas of the caribbean africa south asia southeast asia and oceania 18 it is a coofficial language of the united nations the european union and many other international and regional organisations english accounts for at least 70% of speakers of the germanic language branch of the indoeuropean family

a hypothetical family tree of the west germanic language family
english is an indoeuropean language and belongs to the west germanic group of the germanic languages 19 old english originated from a germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the frisian north sea coast whose languages gradually evolved into the anglic languages in the british isles and into the frisian languages and low german low saxon on the continent the frisian languages which together with the anglic languages form the anglofrisian languages are the closest living relatives of english low german low saxon is also closely related and sometimes english the frisian languages and low german are grouped together as the ingvaeonic north sea germanic languages though this grouping remains debated 8 old english evolved into middle english which in turn evolved into modern english 20 particular dialects of old and middle english also developed into a number of other anglic languages including scots 21 and the extinct fingallian and forth and bargy yola dialects of ireland 22

like icelandic and faroese the development of english in the british isles isolated it from the continental germanic languages and influences and it has since diverged considerably english is not mutually intelligible with any continental germanic language differing in vocabulary syntax and phonology although some of these such as dutch or frisian do show strong affinities with english especially with its earlier stages 23

unlike icelandic and faroese which were isolated the development of english was influenced by a long series of invasions of the british isles by other peoples and languages particularly old norse and norman french these left a profound mark of their own on the language so that english shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic cladesbut it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either some scholars have argued that english can be considered a mixed language or a creolea theory called the middle english creole hypothesis although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of modern english is widely acknowledged most specialists in language contact do not consider english to be a true mixed language 24 25

english is classified as a germanic language because it shares innovations with other germanic languages such as dutch german and swedish 26 these shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called protogermanic some shared features of germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes the use of modal verbs and the sound changes affecting protoindoeuropean consonants known as grimms and verners laws english is classified as an anglofrisian language because frisian and english share other features such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in protogermanic see phonological history of old english palatalization 27

the earliest form of english is called old english or anglosaxon c 5501066 old english developed from a set of west germanic dialects often grouped as anglofrisian or north sea germanic and originally spoken along the coasts of frisia lower saxony and southern jutland by germanic peoples known to the historical record as the angles saxons and jutes 28 from the 5th century the anglosaxons settled britain as the roman economy and administration collapsed by the 7th century the germanic language of the anglosaxons became dominant in britain replacing the languages of roman britain 43409 common brittonic a celtic language and latin brought to britain by the roman occupation 29 30 31 england and english originally nglaland and nglisc are named after the angles 32

old english was divided into four dialects the anglian dialects mercian and northumbrian and the saxon dialects kentish and west saxon 33 through the educational reforms of king alfred in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of wessex the west saxon dialect became the standard written variety 34 the epic poem beowulf is written in west saxon and the earliest english poem cdmons hymn is written in northumbrian 35 modern english developed mainly from mercian but the scots language developed from northumbrian a few short inscriptions from the early period of old english were written using a runic script 36 by the 6th century a latin alphabet was adopted written with halfuncial letterforms it included the runic letters wynn and thorn and the modified latin letters eth and ash 36 37

old english is essentially a distinct language from modern english and is virtually impossible for 21stcentury unstudied englishspeakers to understand its grammar was similar to that of modern german nouns adjectives pronouns and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms and word order was much freer than in modern english modern english has case forms in pronouns he him his and has a few verb inflections speak speaks speaking spoke spoken but old english had case endings in nouns as well and verbs had more person and number endings 38 39 40 its closest relative is old frisian but even some centuries after the anglosaxon migration old english retained considerable mutual intelligibility with other germanic varieties even in the 9th and 10th centuries amidst the danelaw and other viking invasions there is historical evidence that old norse and old english retained considerable mutual intelligibility 41 although probably the northern dialects of old english were more similar to old norse than the southern dialects theoretically as late as the 900s ad a commoner from certain northern parts of england could hold a conversation with a commoner from certain parts of scandinavia research continues into the details of the myriad tribes in peoples in england and scandinavia and the mutual contacts between them 41

from the 8th to the 12th century old english gradually transformed through language contact into middle english middle english is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of england by william the conqueror in 1066 but it developed further in the period from 1200 to 1450

first the waves of norse colonisation of northern parts of the british isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put old english into intense contact with old norse a north germanic language norse influence was strongest in the northeastern varieties of old english spoken in the danelaw area around york which was the centre of norse colonisation today these features are still particularly present in scots and northern english however the centre of norsified english seems to have been in the midlands around lindsey and after 920 ce when lindsey was reincorporated into the anglosaxon polity norse features spread from there into english varieties that had not been in direct contact with norse speakers an element of norse influence that persists in all english varieties today is the group of pronouns beginning with th they them their which replaced the anglosaxon pronouns with h hie him hera 44 other core norse loanwords include give get sky skirt egg and cake typically displacing a native anglosaxon equivalent

with the norman conquest of england in 1066 the nownorsified old english language was subject to contact with old french in particular with the old norman dialect the norman language in england eventually developed into anglonorman 10 because norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles while the lower classes continued speaking anglosaxon english the main influence of norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics legislation and prestigious social domains 9 middle english also greatly simplified the inflectional system probably in order to reconcile old norse and old english which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar the distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns the instrumental case was dropped and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession the inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms 45 and gradually simplified the system of agreement making word order less flexible 46

in wycliffe bible of the 1380s the verse matthew 820 was written foxis han dennes and briddis of heuene han nestis 47 here the plural suffix n on the verb have is still retained but none of the case endings on the nouns are present by the 12th century middle english was fully developed integrating both norse and french features it continued to be spoken until the transition to early modern english around 1500 middle english literature includes geoffrey chaucers the canterbury tales and thomas malorys le morte darthur in the middle english period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as chaucer 48

graphic representation of the great vowel shift showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted with the high vowels i and u breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level
the next period in the history of english was early modern english 15001700 early modern english was characterised by the great vowel shift 13501700 inflectional simplification and linguistic standardisation

the great vowel shift affected the stressed long vowels of middle english it was a chain shift meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system mid and open vowels were raised and close vowels were broken into diphthongs for example the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today the great vowel shift explains many irregularities in spelling since english retains many spellings from middle english and it also explains why english vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages 49 50

english began to rise in prestige relative to norman french during the reign of henry v around 1430 the court of chancery in westminster began using english in its official documents and a new standard form of middle english known as chancery standard developed from the dialects of london and the east midlands in 1476 william caxton introduced the printing press to england and began publishing the first printed books in london expanding the influence of this form of english 51 literature from the early modern period includes the works of william shakespeare and the translation of the bible commissioned by king james i even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from modern english for example the consonant clusters  kn n sw  in knight gnat and sword were still pronounced many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of early modern english 52

spread of modern english
by the late 18th century the british empire had spread english through its colonies and geopolitical dominance commerce science and technology diplomacy art and formal education all contributed to english becoming the first truly global language english also facilitated worldwide international communication 53 3 england continued to form new colonies and these later developed their own norms for speech and writing english was adopted in parts of north america parts of africa oceania and many other regions when they obtained political independence some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using english as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others 54 55 56 in the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the united states and its status as a superpower following the second world war has along with worldwide broadcasting in english by the bbc 57 and other broadcasters caused the language to spread across the planet much faster 58 59 in the 21st century english is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been 60

as modern english developed explicit norms for standard usage were published and spread through official media such as public education and statesponsored publications in 1755 samuel johnson published his a dictionary of the english language which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms in 1828 noah webster published the american dictionary of the english language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing american english that was independent of the british standard within britain nonstandard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes 61

in modern english the loss of grammatical case is almost complete it is now only found in pronouns such as he and him she and her who and whom and svo word order is mostly fixed 61 some changes such as the use of dosupport have become universalised earlier english did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as modern english does at first it was only used in question constructions and even then was not obligatory 62 now dosupport with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised the use of progressive forms in ing appears to be spreading to new constructions and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues eg dreamed instead of dreamt and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common eg more polite instead of politer british english is also undergoing change under the influence of american english fuelled by the strong presence of american english in the media and the prestige associated with the us as a world power 63 64 65

estimates of the numbers of second language and foreignlanguage english speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1 billion depending on how proficiency is defined 18 linguist david crystal estimates that nonnative speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1 79 in kachrus threecircles model the outer circle countries are countries such as the philippines 80 jamaica 81 india pakistan singapore 82 malaysia and nigeria 83 84 with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of english but much use of english as a second language for education government or domestic business and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government 85

those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an englishbased creole to a more standard version of english they have many more speakers of english who acquire english as they grow up through daytoday use and listening to broadcasting especially if they attend schools where english is the medium of instruction varieties of english learned by nonnative speakers born to englishspeaking parents may be influenced especially in their grammar by the other languages spoken by those learners 78 most of those varieties of english include words little used by native speakers of english in the innercircle countries 78 and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from innercircle varieties as well the standard english of the innercircle countries is often taken as a norm for use of english in the outercircle countries 78

in the threecircles model countries such as poland china brazil germany japan indonesia egypt and other countries where english is taught as a foreign language make up the expanding circle 86 the distinctions between english as a first language as a second language and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time 85 for example in the netherlands and some other countries of europe knowledge of english as a second language is nearly universal with over 80 percent of the population able to use it 87 and thus english is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education in these countries although english is not used for government business its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the outer circle and expanding circle english is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of english as a second or foreign language 88

many users of english in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle so that interaction with native speakers of english plays no part in their decision to use the language 89 nonnative varieties of english are widely used for international communication and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties 90 very often today a conversation in english anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of english at all even while including speakers from several different countries this is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences 91

english is a pluricentric language which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language 92 93 94 95 spoken english for example english used in broadcasting generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation international broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents 96 but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written english the norms of standard written english are maintained purely by the consensus of educated englishspeakers around the world without any oversight by any government or international organisation 97

american listeners generally readily understand most british broadcasting and british listeners readily understand most american broadcasting most english speakers around the world can understand radio programmes television programmes and films from many parts of the englishspeaking world 98 both standard and nonstandard varieties of english can include both formal or informal styles distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and nontechnical registers 99

the settlement history of the englishspeaking inner circle countries outside britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of english in south africa australia and new zealand 100 the majority of immigrants to the united states without british ancestry rapidly adopted english after arrival now the majority of the united states population are monolingual english speakers 70 101 and english has been given official or coofficial status by 30 of the 50 state governments as well as all five territorial governments of the us though there has never been an official language at the federal level 102 103

english has ceased to be an english language in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically english 105 106 use of english is growing countrybycountry internally and for international communication most people learn english for practical rather than ideological reasons 107 many speakers of english in africa have become part of an afrosaxon language community that unites africans from different countries 108

as decolonisation proceeded throughout the british empire in the 1950s and 1960s former colonies often did not reject english but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies 55 56 109 for example the view of the english language among many indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress and english continues to be an official language of india 110 english is also widely used in media and literature and the number of english language books published annually in india is the third largest in the world after the us and uk 111 however english is rarely spoken as a first language numbering only around a couple hundredthousand people and less than 5% of the population speak fluent english in india 112 113 david crystal claimed in 2004 that combining native and nonnative speakers india now has more people who speak or understand english than any other country in the world 114 but the number of english speakers in india is uncertain with most scholars concluding that the united states still has more speakers of english than india 115

modern english sometimes described as the first global lingua franca 58 116 is also regarded as the first world language 117 118 english is the worlds most widely used language in newspaper publishing book publishing international telecommunications scientific publishing international trade mass entertainment and diplomacy 118 english is by international treaty the basis for the required controlled natural languages 119 seaspeak and airspeak used as international languages of seafaring 120 and aviation 121 english used to have parity with french and german in scientific research but now it dominates that field 122 it achieved parity with french as a language of diplomacy at the treaty of versailles negotiations in 1919 123 by the time of the foundation of the united nations at the end of world war ii english had become preeminent 124 and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations 125 it is one of six official languages of the united nations 126 many other worldwide international organisations including the international olympic committee specify english as a working language or official language of the organisation

many regional international organisations such as the european free trade association association of southeast asian nations asean 59 and asiapacific economic cooperation apec set english as their organisations sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native english speakers while the european union eu allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the union in practice english is the main working language of eu organisations 127

although in most countries english is not an official language it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language 58 59 in the countries of the eu english is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twentyfive member states where it is not an official language that is the countries other than ireland and malta in a 2012 official eurobarometer poll conducted when the uk was still a member of the eu 38 percent of the eu respondents outside the countries where english is an official language said they could speak english well enough to have a conversation in that language the next most commonly mentioned foreign language french which is the most widely known foreign language in the uk and ireland could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents 128

a working knowledge of english has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine 129 and computing english has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by chemical abstracts in 1998 were written in english as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995 130

international communities such as international business people may use english as an auxiliary language with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest this has led some scholars to develop the study of english as an auxiliary language the trademarked globish uses a relatively small subset of english vocabulary about 1500 words designed to represent the highest use in international business english in combination with the standard english grammar 131 other examples include simple english

the increased use of the english language globally has had an effect on other languages leading to some english words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages this influence of english has led to concerns about language death 132 and to claims of linguistic imperialism 133 and has provoked resistance to the spread of english however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that english provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives 134

although some scholars who mention a possibility of future divergence of english dialects into mutually unintelligible languages most think a more likely outcome is that english will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world 135 english is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world 136 thus english has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language including esperanto 137 138

phonology
main article english phonology
the phonetics and phonology of the english language differ from one dialect to another usually without interfering with mutual communication phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes ie speech sounds that distinguish meaning and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes 139 this overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the united kingdom and the united states received pronunciation rp and general american ga see dialects accents and varieties below

the phonetic symbols used below are from the international phonetic alphabet ipa 140 141 142

consonants

most english dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes the consonant inventory shown below is valid for california english 143 and for rp 144
* conventionally transcribed  r 

in the table when obstruents stops affricates and fricatives appear in pairs such as  p b   t d  and  s z  the first is fortis strong and the second is lenis weak fortis obstruents such as  p t s  are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants such as  b d z  and are always voiceless lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances and fully voiced between vowels fortis stops such as  p  have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects they are aspirated ph when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable often unaspirated in other cases and often unreleased p or preglottalised p at the end of a syllable in a singlesyllable word a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel phonetically but not phonemically than nib nb see below 145

vowels
main article english phonology vowels
the pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speakers accent the table below lists the vowel phonemes in received pronunciation rp and general american ga with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists the vowels are represented with symbols from the international phonetic alphabet those given for rp are standard in british dictionaries and other publications 149
in rp vowel length is phonemic long vowels are marked with a triangular colon in the table above such as the vowel of need nid as opposed to bid bd in ga vowel length is nondistinctive

in both rp and ga vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable like  t t f  but not before lenis consonants like  d d v  or in open syllables thus the vowels of rich rt neat nit and safe sef are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge rd need nid and save sev and the vowel of light lat is shorter than that of lie la because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis 150

the vowel    only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stemfinal positions 151 152 some dialects do not contrast    and    in unstressed positions so that rabbit and abbot rhyme and lenin and lennon are homophonous a dialect feature called weak vowel merger 153 ga  r  and  r  are realised as an rcoloured vowel as in further f phonemically  frr  which in rp is realised as f phonemically  f  154

phonotactics
an english syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound syllable onset and coda start and end are optional a syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds as in sprint  sprnt  and end with up to five as in for some dialects angsts  aksts  this gives an english syllable the following structure ccc v ccccc where c represents a consonant and v a vowel the word strengths  strks  is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in english the consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted as is the order in which they may appear onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters a stop and approximant as in play a voiceless fricative and approximant as in fly or sly s and a voiceless stop as in stay and s a voiceless stop and an approximant as in string 155 clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited furthermore several consonants have limited distributions  h  can only occur in syllableinitial position and    only in syllablefinal position 156

stress rhythm and intonation
see also stress and vowel reduction in english and intonation linguistics english
stress plays an important role in english certain syllables are stressed while others are unstressed stress is a combination of duration intensity vowel quality and sometimes changes in pitch stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not 157 some words primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or nonstressed position within a sentence

stress in english is phonemic and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress for instance the word contract is stressed on the first syllable  kntrkt  kontrakt when used as a noun but on the last syllable  kntrkt  kntrakt for most meanings for example reduce in size when used as a verb 158 159 160 here stress is connected to vowel reduction in the noun contract the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel    but in the verb contract the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to    stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases so that a compound word receives a single stress unit but the corresponding phrase has two eg a burnout  brnat  versus to burn out  brn at  and a hotdog  htd  versus a hot dog  ht d  161

in terms of rhythm english is generally described as a stresstimed language meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal 162 stressed syllables are pronounced longer but unstressed syllables syllables between stresses are shortened vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality vowel reduction 163

regional variation
varieties of english vary the most in pronunciation of vowels the best known national varieties used as standards for education in nonenglishspeaking countries are british bre and american ame countries such as canada australia ireland new zealand and south africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table varieties of standard english and their features 164

english has undergone many historical sound changes some of them affecting all varieties and others affecting only a few most standard varieties are affected by the great vowel shift which changed the pronunciation of long vowels but a few dialects have slightly different results in north america a number of chain shifts such as the northern cities vowel shift and canadian shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents 165

some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties some conservative varieties like scottish english have a voiceless sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced w in wine but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced w a dialect feature called winewhine merger the unvoiced velar fricative sound  x  is found in scottish english which distinguishes loch  lx  from lock  lk  accents like cockney with hdropping lack the glottal fricative  h  and dialects with thstopping and thfronting like africanamerican vernacular and estuary english do not have the dental fricatives     but replace them with dental or alveolar stops  t d  or labiodental fricatives  f v  166 167 other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yoddropping yodcoalescence and reduction of consonant clusters 168 page needed

general american and received pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical  r  after a vowel at the end of a syllable in the syllable coda ga is a rhotic dialect meaning that it pronounces  r  at the end of a syllable but rp is nonrhotic meaning that it loses  r  in that position english dialects are classified as rhotic or nonrhotic depending on whether they elide  r  like rp or keep it like ga 169

there is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels     these four vowels are only distinguished in rp australia new zealand and south africa in ga these vowels merge to three     170 and in canadian english they merge to two     171 in addition the words that have each vowel vary by dialect the table dialects and open vowels shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur

grammar
main article english grammar
as is typical of an indoeuropean language english follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment unlike other indoeuropean languages though english has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class english distinguishes at least seven major word classes verbs nouns adjectives adverbs determiners including articles prepositions and conjunctions some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators and add the class of interjections 172 english also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs such as have and do expressing the categories of mood and aspect questions are marked by dosupport whmovement fronting of question words beginning with wh and word order inversion with some verbs 173

some traits typical of germanic languages persist in english such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut ie changing the vowel of the stem as in the pairs speak spoke and foot feet and weak stems inflected through affixation such as love loved hand hands 174 vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system he him who whom and in the inflection of the copula verb to be 174

the seven wordclasses are exemplified in this sample sentence 175

the	chairman	of	the	committee	and	the	loquacious	politician	clashed	violently	when	the	meeting	started

nouns and noun phrases
main article english nouns
english nouns are only inflected for number and possession new nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding they are semantically divided into proper nouns names and common nouns common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns 176

most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix s but a few nouns have irregular plural forms mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier eg one loaf of bread two loaves of bread 177

regular plural formation

singular cat dog
plural cats dogs
irregular plural formation

singular man woman foot fish ox knife mouse
plural men women feet fish oxen knives mice
possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic s also traditionally called a genitive suffix or by the preposition of historically the s possessive has been used for animate nouns whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns today this distinction is less clear and many speakers use s also with inanimates orthographically the possessive s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe if the noun is plural formed with s the apostrophe follows the s 173

possessive constructions

with s the womans husbands child
with of the child of the husband of the woman
nouns can form noun phrases nps where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners quantifiers conjunctions or adjectives 178 noun phrases can be short such as the man composed only of a determiner and a noun they can also include modifiers such as adjectives eg red tall all and specifiers such as determiners eg the that but they can also tie together several nouns into a single long np using conjunctions such as and or prepositions such as with eg the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles this np uses conjunctions prepositions specifiers and modifiers regardless of length an np functions as a syntactic unit 173 for example the possessive enclitic can in cases which do not lead to ambiguity follow the entire noun phrase as in the president of indias wife where the enclitic follows india and not president

the class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one a definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known quantifiers which include one many some and all are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number the noun must agree with the number of the determiner eg one man sg but all men pl determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase 179

adjectives
main article english adjectives
english adjectives are words such as good big interesting and canadian that most typically modify nouns denoting characteristics of their referents eg a red car as modifiers they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners 180 english adjectives also function as predicative complements eg the child is happy

in modern english adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify as adjectives in most other indoeuropean languages do for example in the phrases the slender boy and many slender girls the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun

some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison with the positive degree unmarked the suffix er marking the comparative and est marking the superlative a small boy the boy is smaller than the girl that boy is the smallest some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms such as good better and best other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions with the adverb more marking the comparative and most marking the superlative happier or more happy the happiest or most happy 181 there is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form 182

determiners
main article english determiners
english determiners are words such as the each many some and which occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite 183 they often agree with the noun in number they do not typically inflect for degree of comparison

pronouns case and person
main article english pronouns
english pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection the personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons i me he him she her we us they them as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular distinguishing it from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular distinguishing between she her feminine they them epicene and he him masculine 184 185 the subjective case corresponds to the old english nominative case and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case for a patient or direct object of a transitive verb and of the old english dative case for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb 186 187 the subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause otherwise the objective is used 188 while grammarians such as henry sweet 189 and otto jespersen 190 noted that the english cases did not correspond to the traditional latinbased system some contemporary grammars for example huddleston & pullum 2002 retain traditional labels for the cases calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively

possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun as in my chair while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun eg the chair is mine 191 the english system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address the old second person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned

both the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular

plural and singular are always identical you your yours in the second person except in the reflexive form yourself yourselves in most dialects some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns such as yall found in southern american english and africanamerican vernacular english youse found in australian english or ye in hibernoenglish
in the third person the they them series of pronouns they them their theirs themselves are used in both plural and singular and are the only pronouns available for the plural in the singular the they them series sometimes with the addition of the singularspecific reflexive form themself serve as a genderneutral set of pronouns these pronouns are becoming more accepted as part of the lgbt culture 184 192 193

pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically a deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situationfor example the pronoun i identifies the speaker and the pronoun you the addressee anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience for example in the sentence i already told you that the reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase eg he sent it to himself or she braced herself for impact 194

prepositions
main article english prepositions
prepositional phrases pp are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns eg with the dog for my friend to school in england 195 prepositions have a wide range of uses in english they are used to describe movement place and other relations between different entities but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs 195 for example in the phrase i gave it to him the preposition to marks the recipient or indirect object of the verb to give traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form with her to me for us but some contemporary grammars such as that of huddleston & pullum 2002598600 no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases citation needed

verbs and verb phrases
main article english verbs
english verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with presenttense thirdperson singular subject only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects 181 auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive past or progressive forms they form complex tenses aspects and moods auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence 196 197

most verbs have six inflectional forms the primary forms are a plain present a thirdperson singular present and a preterite past form the secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive a gerundparticiple and a past participle 198 the copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject the firstperson presenttense form is am the third person singular form is is and the form are is used in the secondperson singular and all three plurals the only verb past participle is been and its gerundparticiple is being
english inflectional forms
inflection	strong	regular
plain present	take	love
3rd person sg
present	takes	loves
preterite	took	loved
plain infinitive 	take	love
gerundparticiple	taking	loving
past participle	taken	loved
tense aspect and mood
english has two primary tenses past preterite and nonpast the preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ed and for the strong verbs either the suffix t or a change in the stem vowel the nonpast form is unmarked except in the third person singular which takes the suffix s 196

present	preterite
first person	i run	i ran
second person	you run	you ran
third person	john runs	john ran
english does not have future verb forms 199 the future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall 200 many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to goingto future 201

future
first person	i will run
second person	you will run
third person	john will run
further aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs primarily have and be which show the contrast between a perfect and nonperfect past tense i have run vs i was running and compound tenses such as preterite perfect i had been running and present perfect i have been running 202

for the expression of mood english uses a number of modal auxiliaries such as can may will shall and the past tense forms could might would should there are also subjunctive and imperative moods both based on the plain form of the verb ie without the third person singular s for use in subordinate clauses eg subjunctive it is important that he run every day imperative run 200

an infinitive form that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form in clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause 203 for example he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive or in a complement clause such as i saw him leave where the main verb is see which is in a preterite form and leave is in the infinitive

phrasal verbs
english also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb the phrase then functions as a single predicate in terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb but in writing it is written as a separate word examples of phrasal verbs are to get up to ask out to back up to give up to get together to hang out to put up with etc the phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement eg lay off meaning terminate someones employment 204 in spite of the idiomatic meaning some grammarians including huddleston & pullum 2002274 do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term phrasal verb instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement ie he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent

adverbs
main article english adverbs
the function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs 173 many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix ly for example in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly is derived in this way from the adjective quick some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms such as good which has the adverbial form well

syntax

in the english sentence the cat sat on the mat the subject is the cat a noun phrase the verb is sat and on the mat is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase the mat headed by the preposition on the tree describes the structure of the sentence
modern english syntax language is moderately analytic 205 it has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions negative polarity the passive voice and progressive aspect

basic constituent order
english word order has moved from the germanic verbsecond v2 word order to being almost exclusively subjectverbobject svo 206 the combination of svo order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence such as he had hoped to try to open it

in most sentences english only marks grammatical relations through word order 207 the subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it the example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb

the dog	bites	the man
s	v	o
the man	bites	the dog
s	v	o
an exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun in which case it is doubly marked both by word order and by case inflection where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form 208 the example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun

he	hit	him
s	v	o
indirect objects io of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction s v io o such as i gave jane the book or in a prepositional phrase such as i gave the book to jane 209

clause syntax
main article english clause syntax
in english a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases eg noun phrases verb phrases and prepositional phrases a clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents such as any nps and pps within a sentence there is always at least one main clause or matrix clause whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause for example in the phrase i think that you are lying the main clause is headed by the verb think the subject is i but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause that you are lying the subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause but it is often omitted 210 relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause for example in the sentence i saw the letter that you received today the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter the object of the main clause relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who whose whom and which as well as by that which can also be omitted 211 in contrast to many other germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses 212

auxiliary verb constructions
main articles dosupport english auxiliary verbs and subjectauxiliary inversion
english syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense aspect and mood auxiliary verbs form main clauses and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb for example in the sentence the dog did not find its bone the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not subjectauxiliary inversion is used in many constructions including focus negation and interrogative constructions

the verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences where it usually serves to add emphasis as in i did shut the fridge however in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above it is used because the rules of english syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present modern english does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb as in *i know notit can only be added to an auxiliary or copular verb hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required the auxiliary do is used to produce a form like i do not dont know the same applies in clauses requiring inversion including most questionsinversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb so it is not possible to say *know you him grammatical rules require do you know him 213

negation is done with the adverb not which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb a contracted form of not nt can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be just as with questions many negative constructions require the negation to occur with dosupport thus in modern english i dont know him is the correct answer to the question do you know him but not *i know him not although this construction may be found in older english 214

passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs a passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase they are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get although not all varieties of english allow the use of passives with get for example putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen by her or he gets seen by her 215

questions
both yesno questions and whquestions in english are mostly formed using subjectauxiliary inversion am i going tomorrow where can we eat which may require dosupport do you like her where did he go in most cases interrogative words whwords eg what who where when why how appear in a fronted position for example in the question what did you see the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence when the whword is the subject or forms part of the subject no inversion occurs who saw the cat prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the questions theme eg to whose house did you go last night the personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case with the variant whom serving as the objective case form although this form may be going out of use in many contexts 216

discourse level syntax
while english is a subjectprominent language at the discourse level it tends to use a topiccomment structure where the known information topic precedes the new information comment because of the strict svo syntax the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence in cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means one way of doing this is through a passive construction the girl was stung by the bee another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there eg it was the girl that the bee stung there was a girl who was stung by a bee 217 dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs eg it is raining or in existential clauses there are many cars on the street through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects english is able to maintain both a topiccomment sentence structure and a svo syntax

focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent for example the girl was stung by a bee emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her or the girl was stung by a bee contrasting with another possibility for example that it was the boy 218 topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause for example that girl over there she was stung by a bee emphasises the girl by preposition but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition she was stung by a bee that girl over there where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought 219

cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora eg that is exactly what i mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event 220 discourse markers such as oh so or well also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said for example no way is that true the idiomatic marker no way expressing disbelief or boy im hungry the marker boy expressing emphasis while discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of english they are also used in written and formal registers 221

vocabulary
see also foreignlanguage influences in english
it is generally stated that english has around 170000 words or 220000 if obsolete words are counted this estimate is based on the last full edition of the oxford english dictionary from 1989 222 over half of these words are nouns a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs there is one count that puts the english vocabulary at about 1 million wordsbut that count presumably includes words such as latin species names scientific terminology botanical terms prefixed and suffixed words jargon foreign words of extremely limited english use and technical acronyms 223

due to its status as an international language english adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources early studies of english vocabulary by lexicographers the scholars who formally study vocabulary compile dictionaries or both were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from goodquality linguistic corpora 224 collections of actual written texts and spoken passages many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of english vocabulary over time the dates of first use of various words in english and the sources of english vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available 223 225

word formation processes
english forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes one of the most productive processes in english is conversion 226 using a word with a different grammatical role for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun another productive wordformation process is nominal compounding 223 225 producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick 226 a process more common in old english than in modern english but still productive in modern english is the use of derivational suffixes hood ness ing ility to derive new words from existing words especially those of germanic origin or stems especially for words of latin or greek origin

formation of new words called neologisms based on greek and or latin roots for example television or optometry is a highly productive process in english and in most modern european languages so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated for this reason american lexicographer philip gove attributed many such words to the international scientific vocabulary isv when compiling websters third new international dictionary 1961 another active wordformation process in english are acronyms 227 words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases eg nato laser

english besides forming new words from existing words and their roots also borrows words from other languages this borrowing is commonplace in many world languages but english has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1000 years 229 nevertheless most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in english are still west germanic 230 231 the english words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly germanic words from old english 223 it is not possible to speak or write english without germanic words but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in english without foreign loanwords 232

but one of the consequences of long language contact between french and english in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of english has a very high percentage of latinate words derived from french especially and also from other romance languages and latin french words from various periods of the development of french now make up onethird of the vocabulary of english 233 linguist anthony lacoudre estimated that over 40000 english words are of french origin and may be understood without orthographical change by french speakers 234 words of old norse origin have entered the english language primarily from the contact between old norse and old english during colonisation of eastern and northern england many of these words are part of english core vocabulary such as egg and knife 235

english has also borrowed many words directly from latin the ancestor of the romance languages during all stages of its development 225 223 many of these words had earlier been borrowed into latin from greek latin or greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences philosophy and mathematics 236 english continues to gain new loanwords and calques loan translations from languages all over the world and words from languages other than the ancestral anglosaxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of english 237

english has formal and informal speech registers informal registers including childdirected speech tend to be made up predominantly of words of anglosaxon origin while the percentage of vocabulary that is of latinate origin is higher in legal scientific and academic texts 238 239

english loanwords and calques in other languages
english has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages 233 240 the influence of english comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the english language the role of english as a world lingua franca and the large number of books and films that are translated from english into other languages 241 that pervasive use of english leads to a conclusion in many places that english is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies among varieties of english it is especially american english that influences other languages 242 some languages such as chinese write words borrowed from english mostly as calques while others such as japanese readily take in english loanwords written in soundindicating script 243 dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of english influence on languages in europe 243

writing system
see also english alphabet english braille and english orthography
since the ninth century english has been written in a latin alphabet also called roman alphabet earlier old english texts in anglosaxon runes are only short inscriptions the great majority of literary works in old english that survive to today are written in the roman alphabet 36 the modern english alphabet contains 26 letters of the latin script a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z which also have capital forms a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

the spelling system or orthography of english is multilayered and complex with elements of french latin and greek spelling on top of the native germanic system 244 further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace 49 compared to european languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms english has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced 245 there are also systematic spelling differences between british and american english these situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in english 246

although letters and speech sounds do not have a onetoone correspondence in standard english spelling spelling rules that take into account syllable structure phonetic changes in derived words and word accent are reliable for most english words 247 moreover standard english spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling for example the words photograph photography and photographic 247 or the words electricity and electrical while few scholars agree with chomsky and halle 1968 that conventional english orthography is nearoptimal 244 there is a rationale for current english spelling patterns 248 the standard orthography of english is the most widely used writing system in the world 249 standard english spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word 250

readers of english can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds the letters b d f h j k l m n p r s t v w y z represent respectively the phonemes  b d f h d k l m n p r s t v w j z  the letters c and g normally represent  k  and    but there is also a soft c pronounced  s  and a soft g pronounced  d  the differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard english spelling digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for  t  sh for    th for    or    ng for    qu for  kw  and ph for  f  in greekderived words the single letter x is generally pronounced as  z  in wordinitial position and as  ks  otherwise there are exceptions to these generalisations often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin 247 or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of modern english to follow the spelling patterns of latin for english words of germanic origin 251

for the vowel sounds of the english language however correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular there are many more vowel phonemes in english than there are single vowel letters a e i o u w y as a result some long vowels are often indicated by combinations of letters like the oa in boat the ow in how and the ay in stay or the historically based silent e as in note and cake 248

the consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in english it can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of english than of many other languages including italian spanish and german 252 nonetheless there is an advantage for learners of english reading in learning the specific soundsymbol regularities that occur in the standard english spellings of commonly used words 247 such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in english 253 254 making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in english may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write english 255

english writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world the purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud 256

dialects accents and varieties
main articles list of dialects of english world englishes and regional accents of english
dialectologists identify many english dialects which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar vocabulary and pronunciation the pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents the major native dialects of english are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of british english bre and north american english nae 257 there also exists a third common major grouping of english varieties southern hemisphere english the most prominent being australian and new zealand english

britain and ireland

since the english language first evolved in britain and ireland the archipelago is home to the languages most diverse dialects particularly in england 258 within the united kingdom the received pronunciation rp an educated dialect of south east england is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the british dialects the spread of rp also known as bbc english through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural england to recede as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects at the time of the survey of english dialects grammar and vocabulary differed across the country but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear 259

nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary in fact only 3% of the english population actually speak rp the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of rp influence 260 there is also variability within rp particularly along class lines between upper and middleclass rp speakers and between native rp speakers and speakers who adopt rp later in life 261 within britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class some traits though exceedingly common are nonetheless considered nonstandard and associated with lowerclass speakers and identities an example of this is hdropping which was historically a feature of lowerclass london english particularly cockney and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of england however it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of british society 262

english in england can be divided into four major dialect regions southwest english south east english midlands english and northern english within each of these regions several local subdialects exist within the northern region there is a division between the yorkshire dialects and the geordie dialect spoken in northumbria around newcastle and the lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in liverpool scouse and manchester mancunian having been the centre of danish occupation during the viking invasions northern english dialects particularly the yorkshire dialect retain norse features not found in other english varieties 263

since the 15th century southeastern england varieties have centred on london which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects in london the cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes and it was long a socially stigmatised variety the spread of cockney features across the southeast led the media to talk of estuary english as a new dialect but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that london had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history 264 265 266 traits that have spread from london in recent decades include the use of intrusive r drawing is pronounced drawring  drr  tglottalisation potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as poer  p  and the pronunciation of th as  f  thanks pronounced fanks or  v  bother pronounced bover 267

scots is today considered a separate language from english but it has its origins in early northern middle english 268 and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources particularly scots gaelic and old norse scots itself has a number of regional dialects and in addition to scots scottish english comprises the varieties of standard english spoken in scotland most varieties are northern english accents with some influence from scots 269

in ireland various forms of english have been spoken since the norman invasions of the 11th century in county wexford in the area surrounding dublin two extinct dialects known as forth and bargy and fingallian developed as offshoots from early middle english and were spoken until the 19th century modern irish english however has its roots in english colonisation in the 17th century today irish english is divided into ulster english the northern ireland dialect with strong influence from scots and various dialects of the republic of ireland like scottish and most north american accents almost all irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by rp 22 270

north american english has been regarded as fairly homogeneous compared to british english but this has been disputed 271 today american accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level 272 though most americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents 273 known collectively as general american ga with differences hardly noticed even among americans themselves such as midland and western american english 274 275 276 in most american and canadian english dialects rhoticity or rfulness is dominant with nonrhoticity or rdropping being associated with lower prestige and social class especially since the end of world war ii this contrasts with the situation in england where nonrhoticity has become the standard 277

separate from ga are american dialects with clearly distinct sound systems historically including southern american english english of the coastal northeast famously including eastern new england english and new york city english and africanamerican vernacular english all of which are historically nonrhotic canadian english except for the atlantic provinces and perhaps quebec may be classified under ga as well but it often shows the raising of the vowels  a  and  a  before voiceless consonants as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards 278

in southern american english the most populous american accent group outside of ga 279 rhoticity now strongly prevails replacing the regions historical nonrhotic prestige 280 281 282 southern accents are colloquially described as a drawl or twang 283 being recognised most readily by the southern vowel shift initiated by glidedeleting in the  a  vowel eg pronouncing spy almost like spa the southern breaking of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables eg pronouncing the word press almost like prayus 284 the pinpen merger and other distinctive phonological grammatical and lexical features many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later 285

today spoken primarily by working and middleclass african americans africanamerican vernacular english aave is also largely nonrhotic and likely originated among enslaved africans and african americans influenced primarily by the nonrhotic nonstandard older southern dialects a minority of linguists 286 contrarily propose that aave mostly traces back to african languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or creole english to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins 287 aaves important commonalities with southern accents suggests it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century aave is commonly stigmatised in north america as a form of broken or uneducated english as are white southern accents but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of english with their own norms shared by a large speech community 288 289

australia and new zealand
main articles australian english and new zealand english

since 1788 english has been spoken in oceania and australian english has developed as the first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the australian continent its standard accent being general australian the english of neighbouring new zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language 290 australian and new zealand english are each others closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics followed by south african english and the english of southeastern england all of which have similarly nonrhotic accents aside from some accents in the south island of new zealand australian and new zealand english stand out for their innovative vowels many short vowels are fronted or raised whereas many long vowels have diphthongised australian english also has a contrast between long and short vowels not found in most other varieties australian english grammar aligns closely with british and american english like american english collective plural subjects take on a singular verb as in the government is rather than are 291 292 new zealand english uses front vowels that are often even higher than in australian english 293 294 295
the first significant exposure of the philippines to the english language occurred in 1762 when the british occupied manila during the seven years war but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence english later became more important and widespread during american rule between 1898 and 1946 and remains an official language of the philippines today the use of english is ubiquitous in the philippines being found on street signs and marquees in government documents and forms in courtrooms in the media and entertainment industries in the business sector and in various other aspects of daily life one particularly prominent form of english usage in the country is found in everyday speech most filipinos from manila use or at the very least have been exposed to taglish a form of codeswitching between tagalog and english a similar codeswitching method is used by urban native speakers of bisayan languages under the name of bislish
english is spoken widely in southern africa and is an official or coofficial language in several countries in south africa english has been spoken since 1820 coexisting with afrikaans and various african languages such as the khoe and bantu languages today about 9 percent of the south african population speaks south african english sae as a first language sae is a nonrhotic variety which tends to follow rp as a norm it is one of the few nonrhotic english varieties that lack intrusive r there are different l2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers 296 most phonological differences from rp are in the vowels 297 consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce  p t t k  without aspiration eg pin pronounced pn rather than as phn as in most other varieties while r is often pronounced as a flap instead of as the more common fricative 298

nigerian english is a dialect of english spoken in nigeria 299 it is based on british english but in recent years because of influence from the united states some words of american english origin have made it into nigerian english additionally some new words and collocations have emerged from the language which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation eg senior wife over 150 million nigerians speak english 300

several varieties of english are also spoken in the caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of britain including jamaica the leeward and windward islands and trinidad and tobago barbados the cayman islands and belize each of these areas is home both to a local variety of english and a local englishbased creole combining english and african languages the most prominent varieties are jamaican english and jamaican creole in central america englishbased creoles are spoken on the caribbean coasts of nicaragua and panama 301 locals are often fluent both in the local english variety and the local creole languages and codeswitching between them is frequent indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between creole and standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the creole forms serving as basilect and the more rplike forms serving as the acrolect the most formal register 302

most caribbean varieties are based on british english and consequently most are nonrhotic except for formal styles of jamaican english which are often rhotic jamaican english differs from rp in its vowel inventory which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in standard english the diphthongs  ei  and  ou  are monophthongs e and o or even the reverse diphthongs ie and uo eg bay and boat pronounced bje and bwot often wordfinal consonant clusters are simplified so that child is pronounced tail and wind win 303 304 305

as a historical legacy indian english tends to take rp as its ideal and how well this ideal is realised in an individuals speech reflects class distinctions among indian english speakers indian english accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as  t  and  d  often pronounced with retroflex articulation as and and the replacement of    and    with dentals t and d sometimes indian english speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent h found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an indian voiced aspirated stop 306

while conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites27 they called this algorithm pagerank it determined a websites relevance by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site2829 page told his ideas to hassan who began writing the code to implement pages ideas23

page and brin originally nicknamed the new search engine backrub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site203031 hassan as well as alan steremberg were cited by page and brin as being critical to the development of google rajeev motwani and terry winograd later coauthored with page and brin the first paper about the project describing pagerank and the initial prototype of the google search engine published in 1998 hector garciamolina and jeff ullman were also cited as contributors to the project32 pagerank was influenced by a similar pageranking and sitescoring algorithm earlier used for rankdex developed by robin li in 1996 with larry pages pagerank patent including a citation to lis earlier rankdex patent li later went on to create the chinese search engine baidu3334

eventually they changed the name to google the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol203536 a very large number written 10100 1 followed by 100 zeros picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information37

in linguistics the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural rules on speakers or writers usage and creation of clauses phrases and words the term can also refer to the study of such rules a subject that includes phonology morphology and syntax together with phonetics semantics and pragmatics there are two different ways to study grammar right now traditional grammar and theoretical grammar

fluent speakers of a language variety or lect have internalised these rules 1 the vast majority of which at least in the case of ones native language s are acquired not by intentional study or instruction but by hearing other speakers much of this internalisation occurs during early childhood learning a language later in life usually involves more direct instruction 2 in this view grammar is defined to be as the information in the mind that is implied in a specific instance of used language

the term grammar can also describe the linguistic behaviour of groups of speakers and writers rather than individuals differences in scale are important to this meaning for example the term english grammar could refer to the whole of english grammar that is to the grammar of all the languages speakers in which case it covers lots of variation 3 at a smaller scale it may refer only to what is shared among the grammars of all or most english speakers such as subjectverbobject word order in simple sentences at the smallest scale this sense of grammar can describe the conventions of just one form of english that is better defined than others such as standard english for a region

a description study or analysis of such rules may also be known as grammar a reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a reference grammar or simply a grammar see history of english grammars a fully revealed grammar which describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech type in great detail is called descriptive grammar this kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription a plan to actively ban or lessen the use of some constructions while popularising and starting others either absolutely or about a standard variety for example some pedants insist that sentences in english should not end with prepositions a ban that has been traced to john dryden 16311700 his unjustified rejection of the practice may have led other english speakers to avoid it and discourage its use 4 5 yet ending sentences with a preposition has a long history in germanic languages like english where it is so widespread that it is the norm

outside linguistics the word grammar often has a different meaning it may be used more widely to include rules of spelling and punctuation which linguists would not typically consider as part of grammar but rather of orthography the conventions used for writing a language it may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only excluding the aspects of a languages grammar which do notchange or are clearly acceptable or not without the need for discussions jeremy butterfield claimed that for nonlinguists grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of english that people object to 6

etymology
the word grammar is derived from greek grammatike techne which means art of letters from gramma letter itself from graphein to draw to write 7 the same greek root also appears in the words graphics grapheme and photograph

history
further information history of linguistics
the first systematic grammar of sanskrit originated in iron age india with yaska 6th century bc panini 6th5th century bc 8 and his commentators pingala c 200 bc katyayana and patanjali 2nd century bc tolkappiyam the earliest tamil grammar is mostly dated to before the 5th century ad the babylonians also made some early attempts at language description 9

grammar appeared as a discipline in hellenism from the 3rd century bc forward with authors such as rhyanus and aristarchus of samothrace the oldest known grammar handbook is the art of grammar a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively written by the ancient greek scholar dionysius thrax c 170c 90 bc a student of aristarchus of samothrace who founded a school on the greek island of rhodes dionysius thraxs grammar book remained the primary grammar textbook for greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century ad the romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today 10 latin grammar developed by following greek models from the 1st century bc due to the work of authors such as orbilius pupillus remmius palaemon marcus valerius probus verrius flaccus and aemilius asper

the grammar of irish originated in the 7th century with auraicept na neces arabic grammar emerged with abu alaswad alduali in the 7th century the first treatises on hebrew grammar appeared in the high middle ages in the context of mishnah exegesis of the hebrew bible the karaite tradition originated in abbasid baghdad the diqduq 10th century is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the hebrew bible 11 ibn barun in the 12th century compares the hebrew language with arabic in the islamic grammatical tradition 12

belonging to the trivium of the seven liberal arts grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the middle ages following the influence of authors from late antiquity such as priscian treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the high middle ages with isolated works such as the first grammatical treatise but became influential only in the renaissance and baroque periods in 1486 antonio de nebrija published las introduciones latinas contrapuesto el romance al latin and the first spanish grammar gramatica de la lengua castellana in 1492 during the 16thcentury italian renaissance the questione della lingua was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the italian language initiated by dantes de vulgari eloquentia pietro bembo prose della volgar lingua venice 1525 the first grammar of slovene was written in 1583 by adam bohoric and grammatica germanicae linguae the first grammar of german was published in 1578

grammars of some languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evangelism and bible translation from the 16th century onward such as grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del peru 1560 a quechua grammar by fray domingo de santo tomas

from the latter part of the 18th century grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics the deutsche grammatik of jacob grimm was first published in the 1810s the comparative grammar of franz bopp the starting point of modern comparative linguistics came out in 1833

a word is a basic element of language that carries an objective or practical meaning can be used on its own and is uninterruptible 1 despite the fact that language speakers often have an intuitive grasp of what a word is there is no consensus among linguists on its definition and numerous attempts to find specific criteria of the concept remain controversial 2 different standards have been proposed depending on the theoretical background and descriptive context these do not converge on a single definition 3 13618 some specific definitions of the term word are employed to convey its different meanings at different levels of description for example based on phonological grammatical or orthographic basis others suggest that the concept is simply a convention used in everyday situations 4 6

the concept of word is distinguished from that of a morpheme which is the smallest unit of language that has a meaning even if it cannot stand on its own 1 words are made out of at least one morpheme morphemes can also be joined to create other words in a process of morphological derivation 2 768 in english and many other languages the morphemes that make up a word generally include at least one root  such as rock god type writ can not and possibly some affixes  s un ly ness words with more than one root   type writ er cow boy s tele graph ically are called compound words in turn words are combined to form other elements of language such as phrases  a red rock put up with clauses  i threw a rock and sentences  i threw a rock but missed

in many languages the notion of what constitutes a word may be learned as part of learning the writing system 5 this is the case for the english language and for most languages that are written with alphabets derived from the ancient latin or greek alphabets in english orthography the letter sequences rock god write with the and not are considered to be singlemorpheme words whereas rocks ungodliness typewriter and cannot are words composed of two or more morphemes  rock+s un+god+li+ness type+writ+er and can+not

definitions and meanings
since the beginning of the study of linguistics numerous attempts at defining what a word is have been made with many different criteria 5 however no satisfying definition has yet been found to apply to all languages and at all levels of linguistic analysis it is however possible to find consistent definitions of word at different levels of description 4 6 these include definitions on the phonetic and phonological level that it is the smallest segment of sound that can be theoretically isolated by word accent and boundary markers on the orthographic level as a segment indicated by blank spaces in writing or print on the basis of morphology as the basic element of grammatical paradigms like inflection different from wordforms within semantics as the smallest and relatively independent carrier of meaning in a lexicon and syntactically as the smallest permutable and substitutable unit of a sentence 2 1285

in some languages these different types of words coincide and one can analyze for example a phonological word as essentially the same as grammatical word however in other languages they may correspond to elements of different size 4 1 much of the difficulty stems from the eurocentric bias as languages from outside of europe may not follow the intuitions of european scholars some of the criteria developed for word can only be applicable to languages of broadly european synthetic structure 4 13 because of this unclear status some linguists propose avoiding the term word altogether instead focusing on better defined terms such as morphemes 6

dictionaries categorize a languages lexicon into individually listed forms called lemmas these can be taken as an indication of what constitutes a word in the opinion of the writers of that language this written form of a word constitutes a lexeme 2 670671 the most appropriate means of measuring the length of a word is by counting its syllables or morphemes 7 when a word has multiple definitions or multiple senses it may result in confusion in a debate or discussion 8

phonology
one distinguishable meaning of the term word can be defined on phonological grounds it is a unit larger or equal to a syllable which can be distinguished based on segmental or prosodic features or through its interactions with phonological rules in walmatjari an australian language roots or suffixes may have only one syllable but a phonologic word must have at least two syllables a disyllabic verb root may take a zero suffix eg luwa hit but a monosyllabic root must take a suffix eg yanta go thus conforming to a segmental pattern of walmatjari words in the pitjantjatjara dialect of the wati language another language form australia a wordmedial syllable can end with a consonant but a wordfinal syllable must end with a vowel 4 14

in most languages stress may serve a criterion for a phonological word in languages with a fixed stress it is possible to ascertain word boundaries from its location although it is impossible to predict word boundaries from stress alone in languages with phonemic stress there will be just one syllable with primary stress per word which allows for determining the total number of words in an utterance 4 16

many phonological rules operate only within a phonological word or specifically across word boundaries in hungarian dental consonants /d/ /t/ /l/ or /n/ assimilate to a following semivowel /j/ yielding the corresponding palatal sound but only within one word conversely external sandhi rules act across word boundaries the prototypical example of this rule comes from sanskrit however initial consonant mutation in contemporary celtic languages or the linking r phenomenon in some nonrhotic english dialects can also be used to illustrate word boundaries 4 17

it is often the case that a phonological word does not correspond to our intuitive conception of a word the finnish compound word paakaupunki capital is phonologically two words  paa head and kaupunki city because it does not conform to finnish patterns of vowel harmony within words conversely a single phonological word may be made up of more than one syntactical elements such as in the english phrase ill come where ill forms one phonological word 3 13618

lexemes
a word can be thought of as an item in a speakers internal lexicon this is called a lexeme however this may be different from the meaning in everyday speech of word since one lexemes includes all inflected forms the lexeme teapot refers to the singular teapot as well as the plural teapots there is also the question to what extent should inflected or compounded words be included in a lexeme especially in agglutinative languages for example there is little doubt that in turkish the lexeme for house should include nominative singular ev and plural evler however it is not clear if it should also encompass the word evlerinizden from your houses formed through regular suffixation there are also lexemes such as black and white or doityourself which although consisting of multiple words still form a single collocation with a set meaning 3 13618

grammar
grammatical words are proposed to consist of a number of grammatical elements which occur together  not in separate places within a clause in a fixed order and have a set meaning however there are exceptions to all of these criteria 4 19

single grammatical words have a fixed internal structure when the structure is changed the meaning of the word also changes in dyirbal which can use many derivational affixes with its nouns there are the dual suffix jarran and the suffix gabun meaning another with the noun yibi they can be arranged into yibijarrangabun  another two women or yibigabunjarran  two other women but changing the suffix order also changes their meaning speakers of a language also usually associate a specific meaning with a word and not a single morpheme for example when asked to talk about untruthfulness they rarely focus on the meaning of morphemes such as th or ness 4 1920

semantics
leonard bloomfield introduced the concept of minimal free forms in 1928 words are thought of as the smallest meaningful unit of speech that can stand by themselves 9 11 this correlates phonemes  units of sound to lexemes  units of meaning however some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves  for example the and of 10 77 some semanticists have put forward a theory of socalled semantic primitives or semantic primes indefinable words representing fundamental concepts that are intuitively meaningful according to this theory semantic primes serve as the basis for describing the meaning without circularity of other words and their associated conceptual denotations 11 12

features
in the minimalist school of theoretical syntax words  also called lexical items in the literature are construed as bundles of linguistic features that are united into a structure with form and meaning 13 3637 for example the word koalas has semantic features  it denotes realworld objects koalas category features  it is a noun number features  it is plural and must agree with verbs pronouns and demonstratives in its domain phonological features  it is pronounced a certain way etc

orthography

words made out of letters divided by spaces
in languages with a literary tradition the question of what is considered a single word is influenced by orthography word separators typically spaces and punctuation marks are common in modern orthography of languages using alphabetic scripts but these are a relatively modern development in the history of writing in character encoding word segmentation depends on which characters are defined as word dividers in english orthography compound expressions may contain spaces for example ice cream air raid shelter and get up each are generally considered to consist of more than one word  as each of the components are free forms with the possible exception of get and so is no one but the similarly compounded someone and nobody are considered single words

sometimes languages which are close grammatically will consider the same order of words in different ways for example reflexive verbs in the french infinitive are separate from their respective particle eg se laver  to wash oneself whereas in portuguese they are hyphenated eg lavarse and in spanish they are joined eg lavarse a

not all languages delimit words expressly mandarin chinese is a highly analytic language with few inflectional affixes making it unnecessary to delimit words orthographically however there are many multiplemorpheme compounds in mandarin as well as a variety of bound morphemes that make it difficult to clearly determine what constitutes a word 14 56 japanese uses orthographic cues to delimit words such as switching between kanji  characters borrowed from chinese writing and the two kana syllabaries this is a fairly soft rule because content words can also be written in hiragana for effect though if done extensively spaces are typically added to maintain legibility vietnamese orthography although using the latin alphabet delimits monosyllabic morphemes rather than words

word boundaries
the task of defining what constitutes a word involves determining where one word ends and another word begins that is identifying word boundaries there are several ways to determine where the word boundaries of spoken language should be placed 5

potential pause a speaker is told to repeat a given sentence slowly allowing for pauses the speaker will tend to insert pauses at the word boundaries however this method is not foolproof the speaker could easily break up polysyllabic words or fail to separate two or more closely linked words  eg to a in he went to a house
indivisibility a speaker is told to say a sentence out loud and then is told to say the sentence again with extra words added to it thus i have lived in this village for ten years might become my family and i have lived in this little village for about ten or so years these extra words will tend to be added in the word boundaries of the original sentence however some languages have infixes which are put inside a root similarly some have separable affixes in the german sentence ich komme gut zu hause an the verb ankommen is separated
phonetic boundaries some languages have particular rules of pronunciation that make it easy to spot where a word boundary should be for example in a language that regularly stresses the last syllable of a word a word boundary is likely to fall after each stressed syllable another example can be seen in a language that has vowel harmony  like turkish 15 9 the vowels within a given word share the same quality so a word boundary is likely to occur whenever the vowel quality changes nevertheless not all languages have such convenient phonetic rules and even those that do present the occasional exceptions
orthographic boundaries word separators such as spaces and punctuation marks can be used to distinguish single words however this depends on a specific language east asian writing systems often do not separate their characters this is the case with chinese japanese writing which use logographic characters as well as thai and lao which are abugidas
morphology
main article morphology  linguistics

a morphology tree of the english word independently
morphology is the study of word formation and structure words may undergo different morphological processes which are traditionally classified into two broad groups derivation and inflection derivation is a process in which a new word is created from existing ones with an adjustment to its meaning and often with a change of word class for example in english the verb to convert may be modified into the noun a convert through stress shift and into the adjective convertible through affixation inflection adds grammatical information to a word such as indicating case tense or gender 14 73

in synthetic languages a single word stem  for example love may inflect to have a number of different forms  for example loves loving and loved however for some purposes these are not usually considered to be different words but rather different forms of the same word in these languages words may be considered to be constructed from a number of morphemes

in indoeuropean languages in particular the morphemes distinguished are

the root
multiple possible adfixes
an inflectional suffix
thus the protoindoeuropean wrdhom would be analyzed as consisting of

wr the zero grade of the root wer
a rootextension dh  diachronically a suffix resulting in a complex root wrdh
the thematic suffix o
the neuter gender nominative or accusative singular suffix m
philosophy
philosophers have found words to be objects of fascination since at least the 5th century bc with the foundation of the philosophy of language plato analyzed words in terms of their origins and the sounds making them up concluding that there was some connection between sound and meaning though words change a great deal over time john locke wrote that the use of words is to be sensible marks of ideas though they are chosen not by any natural connexion that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas for then there would be but one language amongst all men but by a voluntary imposition whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea 16 wittgensteins thought transitioned from a word as representation of meaning to the meaning of a word is its use in the language 17

classes
main article lexical category
each word belongs to a category based on shared grammatical properties typically a languages lexicon may be classified into several such groups of words the total number of categories as well as their types are not universal and vary among languages for example english has a group of words called articles such as the  the definite article or a  the indefinite article which mark definiteness or identifiability this class is not present in japanese which depends on context to indicate this difference on the other hand japanese has a class of words called particles which are used to mark noun phrases according to their grammatical function or thematic relation which english marks using word order or prosody 18 2124

it is not clear if any categories other than interjection are universal parts of human language the basic bipartite division that is ubiquitous in natural languages is that of nouns vs verbs however in some wakashan and salish languages all content words may be understood as verbal in nature in lushootseed a salish language all words with nounlike meanings can be used predicatively where they function like verb for example the word sbiaw can be understood as  is a coyote rather than simply coyote 19 3 13631 on the other hand in eskimoaleut languages all content words can be analyzed as nominal with agentive nouns serving the role closest to verbs finally in some austronesian languages it is not clear whether the distinction is applicable and all words can be best described as interjections which can perform the roles of other categories 3 13631

the current classification of words into classes is based on the work of dionysius thrax who in the 1st century bc distinguished eight categories of ancient greek words noun verb participle article pronoun preposition adverb and conjunction later latin authors apollonius dyscolus and priscian applied his framework to their own language since latin has no articles they replaced this class with interjection adjectives  happy quantifiers  few and numerals  eleven were not made separate in those classifications due to their morphological similarity to nouns in latin and ancient greek they were recognized as distinct categories only when scholars started studying later european languages 3 13629

in indian grammatical tradition panini introduced a similar fundamental classification into a nominal  nama sup and a verbal  akhyata tin class based on the set of suffixes taken by the word some words can be controversial such as slang in formal contexts misnomers due to them not meaning what they would imply or polysemous words due to the potential confusion between their various senses 20

history
in ancient greek and roman grammatical tradition the word was the basic unit of analysis different grammatical forms of a given lexeme were studied however there was no attempt to decompose them into morphemes 21 70 this may have been the result of the synthetic nature of these languages where the internal structure of words may be harder to decode than in analytic languages there was also no concept of different kinds of words such as grammatical or phonological the word was considered a unitary construct 4 269 the word  dictio was defined as the minimal unit of an utterance  oratio the expression of a complete thought 21 70
